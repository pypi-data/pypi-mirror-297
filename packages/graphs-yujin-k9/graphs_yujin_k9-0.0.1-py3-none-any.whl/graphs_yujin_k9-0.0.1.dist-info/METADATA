# Graphs Yujin K9

This project is a Python package that implements Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm among other graph-related algorithms. This package is designed to work with graph data structures and compute shortest paths between nodes efficiently.

## Features

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Computes the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes.
- Extendable for other graph algorithms in the future.

## Installation

To install this package, use the following command:

```bash
pip install -e .
```
