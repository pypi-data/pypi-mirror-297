# head_switcher: Flask Single Page App Frontend Packaging Tool

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/dataset-sh/head_switcher/graph/badge.svg?token=dI9trrckl4)](https://codecov.io/gh/dataset-sh/head_switcher)

This package simplifies the process of packaging and loading frontend assets for your headless flask app.
In another word, this package install and switch **head** for your
**[headless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_software)** flask apps.

## Usage

You need to package your single page app (SPA) frontend assets into a `.frontend` file using our cli tool, and then you
can ship the `.frontend` file with your python packages or simply load it from the file system.

### Package frontend

Assuming you are using create-react-app(CRA), and are using the default build configurations.

```shell
npm run build
# This will create a `build/` folder for the product build.
build-frontend-pack build/ -o path-to-frontend.frontend
```

### How to ship frontend assets with your python project

The following guide assumes that you are using a similar setup with this
[tutorial: Packaging Python Projects](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/)

And we assume your package is called `example_package`.

After using the cli tool to package your frontend assets,
i.e. `build-frontend-pack build/ -o spa_ui.frontend`, you can save the `spa_ui.frontend` file to the
following location `src/example_package/assets/ui.frontend`, and create an empty
file `src/example_package/assets/__init__.py`.

In your `pyproject.toml` file, under `tool.hatch.build` section, make sure the artifacts field contains the
entry `"*.frontend"`

```toml
[tool.hatch.build]
artifacts = [
    "*.frontend"
]
```

Now in your application, you can load the front assets
using `load_from_package_resources('example_package.assets', 'ui.frontend')`.

```python
from head_switcher import install_to_flask, load_from_package_resources

from flask import Flask

assets = load_from_package_resources('example_package.assets', 'ui.frontend')

app = Flask(__name__)
install_to_flask(assets, app)
```

### Install frontend from a file

If you choose to load frontend from a file, you can do it like this.

```python
from head_switcher import install_to_flask, load_from_file_path

from flask import Flask

assets = load_from_file_path('path-to-frontend.frontend')

app = Flask(__name__)
install_to_flask(assets, app)
```
