# caption2text

A lightweight Python module that converts VTT and SRT caption files into plain text transcripts.

## Features

- Convert WebVTT (.vtt) files to plain text transcripts
- Convert SubRip (.srt) files to plain text transcripts
- Easy-to-use Python API
- Command-line interface (CLI) for quick conversions

## Installation

You can install caption2text using pip:

```bash
pip install caption2text
````

## Usage

### Python API

```python
from caption2text import vtt_to_transcript, srt_to_transcript

# Convert VTT file to transcript
vtt_transcript = vtt_to_transcript('path/to/your/file.vtt')
print(vtt_transcript)

# Convert SRT file to transcript
srt_transcript = srt_to_transcript('path/to/your/file.srt')
print(srt_transcript)
```

### Command-line Interface

```bash
# Convert VTT file
caption2text convert path/to/your/file.vtt

# Convert SRT file
caption2text convert path/to/your/file.srt
