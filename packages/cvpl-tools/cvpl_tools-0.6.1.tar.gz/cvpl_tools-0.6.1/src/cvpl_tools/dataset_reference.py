"""
*DEPRECATED*
This file defines DatapointReference and DatasetReference

A dataset reference consists of many data point references. Its job is to make
clear what data files are in the dataset and how they should be read into the
memory (when the dataset is used). A dataset reference can therefore be used
to pass data into a workload, and the reference can be stored as a file afterward
to make the workload reproducible.
