## Typing stubs for tensorflow

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`tensorflow`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`tensorflow`.

This version of `types-tensorflow` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `tensorflow==2.17.*`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/tensorflow. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

Partially generated using [mypy-protobuf==3.6.0](https://github.com/nipunn1313/mypy-protobuf/tree/v3.6.0) and libprotoc 26.1 on `tensorflow==2.17.0`.

This stub package is marked as [partial](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/#partial-stub-packages).
If you find that annotations are missing, feel free to contribute and help complete them.


See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit
[`c025e37bbb67f99f9d83c2eecb79e7405f77359b`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/commit/c025e37bbb67f99f9d83c2eecb79e7405f77359b) and was tested
with mypy 1.11.1, pyright 1.1.381, and
pytype 2024.9.13.
