""" Fakts CLI module.

This module contains the CLI for the fakts package.
It allows you act and interface with the fakts package
from the command line.

Currently it only supports advertising a fakts endpoint
on the local network, but in the future it will also
support other features, like fetching the configuration
from a remote endpoint.
