# PyALFE

Python implementation of Automated Lesion and Feature Extraction (pyALFE) pipeline.
We developed this pipeline for analysis of brain MRIs of patients suffering from conditions that cause brain lesions. It utilizes image processing tools, image registration tools, and deep learning segmentation models to produce a set of features that describe the lesions in the brain.

## Documentation

Details about installation and usage can be found at:
