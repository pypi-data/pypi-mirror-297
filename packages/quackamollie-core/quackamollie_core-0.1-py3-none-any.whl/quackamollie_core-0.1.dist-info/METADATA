Project description
===================
`Quackamollie <https://gitlab.com/forge_of_absurd_ducks/quackamollie/quackamollie>`_ is a `Telegram <https://telegram.org/>`_ chat bot
developed in `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ using the library `aiogram <https://docs.aiogram.dev/en/latest/>`_ to serve LLM models
running locally using `Ollama <https://ollama.com/>`_.

This package is the **core** of the `Quackamollie <https://gitlab.com/forge_of_absurd_ducks/quackamollie/quackamollie>`_ project.
It contains:

- a command line interface which automatically discover addons declared as entrypoints
- the main commands, filters and callbacks for interacting with Quackamollie through Telegram
- `SQLAlchemy <https://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`_ ORM connectors and models to interact with a `PostgreSQL <https://www.postgresql.org/>`_ database for Quackamollie
- `Alembic <https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/>`_ configuration to automatically migrate the `PostgreSQL <https://www.postgresql.org/>`_ database
- a `Docker Compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/>`_ configuration file to run a `PostgreSQL <https://www.postgresql.org/>`_ database
- meta-classes for models and model managers
- auto-discovery of models, model managers and CLI subcommands using entrypoints

To install Quackamollie easily with model managers and models, we kindly invite you to refer to the `Quackamollie main project page <https://gitlab.com/forge_of_absurd_ducks/quackamollie/quackamollie>`_
which includes tutorials to deploy Quackamollie using `Docker Compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/>`_.

This documentation mainly contains details destined to developers of the Quackamollie project.
These information can also be useful for developers who want to run Quackamollie locally without using Docker.

  - N.B.: This automatically generated documentation of the Quackamollie core project is still laking a lot of things. Sorry for the inconvenience.


Install
=======
- Install the application from sources

.. code-block:: bash

   make install
   # or
   pip install .

- Or install it from distribution

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install dist/quackamollie-core-0.1.tar.gz

- Or install it from wheel

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install dist/quackamollie-core-0.1.whl

- Or install it from PyPi repository

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install quackamollie-core  # latest
   # or
   pip install "quackamollie-core==0.1"


Docker
======
- To build the application docker

.. code-block:: bash

   docker build --network=host -t quackamollie_core:0.1 .

- The official Docker image of this project is available at: registry.gitlab.com/forge_of_absurd_ducks/quackamollie/lib/quackamollie_core

- You can pull the image of the current release:

.. code-block:: bash

   docker pull registry.gitlab.com/forge_of_absurd_ducks/quackamollie/lib/quackamollie_core:latest  # or dev
   # or
   docker pull registry.gitlab.com/forge_of_absurd_ducks/quackamollie/lib/quackamollie_core:0.1


Docker-compose
==============
- To run database using docker-compose, you must first set environment variables:

  - `QUACKAMOLLIE_DB_HOST`: typically `0.0.0.0`
  - `QUACKAMOLLIE_DB_PORT`: typically `5432`
  - `QUACKAMOLLIE_DB_NAME`: typically `quackamollie`
  - `QUACKAMOLLIE_DB_USERNAME`: typically `quackamollie`
  - `QUACKAMOLLIE_DB_PASSWORD`: choose a strong admin password

- Then you can run:

.. code-block:: bash

   docker compose up
   # or to detach
   docker compose up -d

   # if you need to run it with sudo don't forget to add the -E option to pass the environment variables you've set
   sudo -E docker compose up

Database migration
==================
- Quackamollie provides a wrapper for the `alembic` command which initializes the database info the same way they are
  initialized at runtime. You can call `alembic` by using instead `quackamollie db alembic`. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   quackamollie db alembic --help

- We recommend you to use a configuration file using one of the examples provided in `config/examples/` and to change
  variables to match the ones used when calling `docker compose up`.

- To create schema revision if the database changes:

.. code-block:: bash

   quackamollie -c config/config.yml db alembic revision --autogenerate -m "A new change."

- You can then inspect the migration code (in python) with:

.. code-block:: bash

   cat migrations/versions/*

- Also inspect the resultant SQL code with:

.. code-block:: bash

   quackamollie -c config/config.yml db alembic upgrade --sql +1

- Finally, you can apply the migration with:

.. code-block:: bash

   quackamollie -c config/config.yml db alembic upgrade +1  # If you want to jump from 1
   quackamollie -c config/config.yml db alembic upgrade head  # If you want to go all the way to head

- If you now connect to ``pgcli``, you can test that the new table exists:

.. code-block:: bash

   make dbtools
   pgcli -U ${QUACKAMOLLIE_DB_USERNAME} -h ${QUACKAMOLLIE_DB_HOST} -p ${QUACKAMOLLIE_DB_PORT} ${QUACKAMOLLIE_DB_NAME}
   # and then on the pgcli console:
   \dt
   # and again on the pgcli console:
   SELECT * FROM users;

- alembic downgrade -1

.. code-block:: bash

   quackamollie -c config/config.yml db alembic downgrade -1

- You can also migrate using the `docker` image from our official docker registry.

.. code-block:: bash

   docker run --rm --name quackamollie-migration \
   --network host \
   --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/config/config.yml,target=/config/config.yml,readonly \
   registry.gitlab.com/forge_of_absurd_ducks/quackamollie/lib/quackamollie_core:0.1 \
   -vvvv -c /config/config.yml db alembic upgrade head

   # if you need to run it with sudo don't forget to add the -E option to pass the environment variables you've set
   sudo -E docker run --rm --name quackamollie-migration \
   --network host \
   --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/config/config.yml,target=/config/config.yml,readonly \
   registry.gitlab.com/forge_of_absurd_ducks/quackamollie/lib/quackamollie_core:0.1 \
   -vvvv -c /config/config.yml db alembic upgrade head

- To do the same using `docker-compose`, please refer to the `quackamollie` main repository.


Running the project
===================
Quackamollie-core provides a command tool line named `quackamollie`.
You can find examples of configuration files in the folder `config/examples`.

.. code-block:: bash

   quackamollie -vvvv -c config/config.yml serve

Pictures and demonstration videos will be included in the documentation in future releases.

Contributing
============
Currently, the project is still in early stages.
It lacks several base features we expect to implement in the versions 0.2 and 0.3, for example RAG capabilities will be added in version 0.2.

For this reason, **we do NOT accept yet issues asking for new features**.
However, you can report bugs or assimilated problems you may encounter and we will do our best to fix them.

If you want to report a bug of `quackamollie-core`, please open an issue in the `Gitlab ticket management section of this project <https://gitlab.com/forge_of_absurd_ducks/quackamollie/lib/quackamollie_core/-/issues>`_
