Generate a {INSERT COMPONENT/S HERE}. It should have no comments within the code, className should be replaced with 'cls', and any icons used should be structured as '<Lucide icon="{icon name}" />', where the icon attribute is a valid icon name from the 'lucide-static' library (NOT lucide-react). It should not use any charts or react/jsx functionality (NO state/ maps etc). It should rely purely on the Shadcn/UI library for handling view toggles and state updates, as per the most recent documentation. There should be no dynamic tailwind class rendering. All styles and components should be hardcoded. Skip ALL import and export statements, and simply have a return statement that returns the code itself (e.g. return(<div>...)). All Card, Alert, Dialog, Table, Carousel, Sheet and Select components, if included, should have an attribute of 'standard' that is set to true.
