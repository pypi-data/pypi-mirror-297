Environmental Science, Urban Planning. Keywords: eco-urbanism, sustainable development, urban ecology  \nabstract: Abstract: This research investigates the intersection of environmental science and urban planning to develop a framework for sustainable urban ecosystems. We pose the research question: How can urban planning practices incorporate ecological principles to enhance sustainability in rapidly growing cities? Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, we analyze case studies of cities that have successfully integrated green infrastructure and ecological design principles, alongside quantitative assessments of urban biodiversity and resource consumption. Key findings reveal that cities employing eco-urbanism principles experience improved air quality, increased biodiversity, and enhanced community well-being. Conclusion: This study underscores the necessity of interdisciplinary collaboration in urban development, advocating for eco-urbanism as a vital strategy for creating resilient and sustainable urban environments.

Keywords: aesthetic algorithm, art trends, data visualization  \nabstract: Abstract: This paper explores the intersection of art history and data science by investigating how algorithmic analysis can reveal underlying trends in artistic movements over time. Our research question centers on: How can data-driven methodologies enhance our understanding of aesthetic evolution in art? We employ machine learning techniques to analyze a dataset of artworks spanning several centuries, focusing on color palettes, composition styles, and thematic elements. Our findings indicate significant correlations between socio-political events and shifts in artistic expression, suggesting that data science can provide new insights into art historical narratives. Conclusion: This interdisciplinary approach not only enriches art historical scholarship but also demonstrates the potential of data science to transform the way we analyze and interpret cultural artifacts.
