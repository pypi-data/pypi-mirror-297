        "title": "Neural Pathways of Historical Trauma: A Psychological and Archaeological Analysis. Rivera, Chen, Schmidt.  March 2024. Psychology, Archaeology. Keywords: historical trauma, stress markers, cognitive archaeology",
        "abstract": "Abstract: This paper examines the psychological impact of historical traumas, such as wars and natural disasters, through archaeological findings to trace long-term effects on communities. By analyzing artifacts and ruins for stress markers and comparing these with modern psychological assessments of trauma descendants, we propose a new interdisciplinary methodology. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that trauma is both inherited and manifested across generations, offering a novel perspective on historical psychology and archaeology's role in understanding human cognitive evolution."
