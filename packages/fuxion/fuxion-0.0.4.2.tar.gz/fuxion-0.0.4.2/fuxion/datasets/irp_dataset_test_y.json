Quantum Physics, Cognitive Science. Keywords: quantum cognition, decision-making, cognitive models\nabstract: Abstract: This research explores the intersection of quantum physics and cognitive science to develop a novel framework for understanding human decision-making processes. By applying principles of quantum mechanics to cognitive models, we investigate how superposition and entanglement can explain complex decision-making behaviors. Utilizing experimental psychology methods alongside quantum simulations, our study reveals that decision-making may not be strictly linear but influenced by probabilistic states. Conclusion: The integration of quantum theory into cognitive science offers a transformative perspective on human cognition, potentially leading to more accurate predictive models of behavior.",

Keywords: acoustic ecology, urban sustainability, soundscapes\nabstract: Abstract: This paper presents an innovative approach to urban planning by incorporating principles from acoustic ecology to design sustainable and livable cities. By analyzing urban soundscapes and their impact on human well-being, we propose new planning strategies that prioritize acoustic environments. Using field recordings, sound mapping, and urban design simulations, our research demonstrates that thoughtful acoustic planning can enhance urban quality of life and environmental health. Conclusion: The fusion of acoustic ecology with urban planning provides a holistic framework for creating cities that are not only functional but also acoustically harmonious.",
