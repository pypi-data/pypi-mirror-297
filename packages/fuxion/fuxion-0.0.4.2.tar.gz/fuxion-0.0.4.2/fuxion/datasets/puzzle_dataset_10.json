Then B must be a liar (since A says B is a liar).", "step_2": "If B is a liar, then B's statement that 'C is a liar' must be false, so C is a truth-teller.", "step_3": "If C is a truth-teller, then C's statement that 'A and B are both liars' must be true. This contradicts our initial assumption that A is a truth-teller. Therefore, A must be a liar. If A is a liar, then B is a truth-teller (since A's statement is false), and C is a liar (since B's statement is true). So, A and C are liars, and B is a truth-teller."}}, {"puzzle_title": "The Magic Square", "description": "You are given a 3x3 grid where each cell must contain a unique number from 1 to 9.
