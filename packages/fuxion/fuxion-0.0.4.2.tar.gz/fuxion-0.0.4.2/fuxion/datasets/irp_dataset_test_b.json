By applying principles of superposition and entanglement to ethical scenarios, we propose a novel framework for understanding and resolving moral conflicts. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that quantum mechanics can offer unique insights into ethical decision-making, potentially transforming traditional philosophical approaches to morality.",
