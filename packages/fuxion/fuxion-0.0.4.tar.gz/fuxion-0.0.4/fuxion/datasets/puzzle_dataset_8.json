Then B must be a liar (since A says B is a liar). If B is a liar, then B's statement that C is a liar must be false, so C is a truth-teller. But if C is a truth-teller, then C's statement that A and B are both liars must be true, which contradicts our assumption that A is a truth-teller.", "step_2": "Assume A is a liar. Then B must be a truth-teller (since A says B is a liar). If B is a truth-teller, then B's statement that C is a liar must be true, so C is a liar.
