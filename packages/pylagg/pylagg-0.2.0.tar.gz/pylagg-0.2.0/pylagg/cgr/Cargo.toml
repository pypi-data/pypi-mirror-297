# ======================

# You can safely remove the code below to let rustimport define your 
# pyo3-configuration automatically. It's still possible to add other 
# configuration or dependencies, or overwrite specific parts here.
# rustimport will merge your Cargo.toml file into it's generated 
# default configuration.
[lib]
# The name of the native library. This is the name which will be used in Python to import the
# library (i.e. `import cgr`).
name = "cgr"
#
# "cdylib" is necessary to produce a shared library for Python to import from.
# Downstream Rust code (including code in `bin/`, `examples/`, and `examples/`) will not be able
# to `use cgr;` unless the "rlib" or "lib" crate type is also included, e.g.:
# crate-type = ["cdylib", "rlib"]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]
