HCLI hak11
==========

HCLI hak11 is a python package wrapper that contains an HCLI sample application (hak11); hak11 is intended to run on a rapsberry pi setup to trigger relays via GPIO. 12 GPIO triggered relays are intended to be setup to interact with a Linear AK-11 keypad to enable remote administration.

----

HCLI hak11 wraps hak11 (an HCLI) and is intended to be used with an HCLI Client [1] as presented via an HCLI Connector [2].

You can find out more about HCLI on hcli.io [3]

AK-11 Keypad Circuit and Relay Setup
====================================

Relay Function
--------------

When activated, a relay closes the circuit between two specific pins of the keypad's 7 pins.

Multiplexing Strategy
---------------------

The relay board correlates the necessary pin combinations for each digit, just as the keypad's internal circuitry does.

Pin correlation (both at the keypad and at the relays):

* Pin 1, 3 connections: "\*0#"
* Pin 2, 4 connections: "147\*"
* Pin 3, 3 connections: "123"
* Pin 4, 4 connections: "2580"
* Pin 5, 4 connections: "369#"
* Pin 6, 3 connections: "456"
* Pin 7, 3 connections: "789"

Installation
------------

HCLI hak11 requires a supported version of Python and pip.

You'll need an HCLI Connector to run hak11. For example, you can use HCLI Core (https://github.com/cometaj2/hcli_core), a WSGI server such as Green Unicorn (https://gunicorn.org/), and an HCLI Client like Huckle (https://github.com/cometaj2/huckle).


.. code-block:: console

    pip install hcli-hak11
    pip install hcli-core
    pip install huckle
    pip install gunicorn
    gunicorn --workers=1 --threads=1 -b 127.0.0.1:8000 "hcli_core:connector(\"`hcli_hak11 path`\")"

Usage
-----

Open a different shell window.

Setup the huckle env eval in your .bash_profile (or other bash configuration) to avoid having to execute eval everytime you want to invoke HCLIs by name (e.g. hc).

Note that no CLI is actually installed by Huckle. Huckle reads the HCLI semantics exposed by the API via HCLI Connector and ends up behaving *like* the CLI it targets.


.. code-block:: console

    huckle cli install http://127.0.0.1:8000
    eval $(huckle env)
    hak11 help

Versioning
----------
    
This project makes use of semantic versioning (http://semver.org) and may make use of the "devx",
"prealphax", "alphax" "betax", and "rcx" extensions where x is a number (e.g. 0.3.0-prealpha1)
on github.

Supports
--------
