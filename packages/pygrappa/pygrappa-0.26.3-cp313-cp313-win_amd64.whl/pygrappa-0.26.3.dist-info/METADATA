About

Online documentation `here <https://pygrappa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_

GRAPPA is a popular parallel imaging reconstruction algorithm.
Unfortunately there aren't a lot of easy to use Python
implementations of it or its many variants available, so I decided to
release this simple package.

There are also a couple reference SENSE-like implementations that
have made their way into the package.  This is to be expected -- a
lot of later parallel imaging algorithms have hints of both GRAPPA-
and SENSE-like inspirations.

Installation should be quick:

.. code-block::

   pip install pygrappa
