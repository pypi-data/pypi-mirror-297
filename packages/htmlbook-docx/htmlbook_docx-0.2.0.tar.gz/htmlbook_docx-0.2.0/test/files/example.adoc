= This is the book/file heading

This file is meant to serve as the source for many of the tests and so on that
this package will eventually contain. It'll be converted via asciidoctor using
the https://github.com/oreillymedia/asciidoctor-htmlbook[O'Reilly Asciidoctor to
Htmlbook backend]. Note the link in this paragraph.

This is body text, a paragraph with _italics_ and *bold* styles, as well as
`code` in-lines. 

== This is a second-level or "chapter" heading

This is body text.

[NOTE]
An admonition!

This is more body text.

=== This is a third-level heading

With some text.

== Lists

Here is an unordered list:

* Apples
* Oranges
* Pears

Here is an ordered list:

. One
. Two
. Three

Now, let's try a definition list:

Some:: Things.

Are:: Meant.

To:: Be or not to be, that is the question.

== Styles and Roles

[role="example"]
Another paragraph of text, except this paragraph has a `role` or style appended
to it. This should come out having a paragraph style of "example."

Here is a paragraph without a style, but which includes text that has an inline
style, for example, [.example]#this span has an example class on it#.
