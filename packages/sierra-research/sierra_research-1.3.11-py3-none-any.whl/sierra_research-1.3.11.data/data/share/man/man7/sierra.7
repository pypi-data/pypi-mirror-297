.TH "SIERRA" "7" "Sep 23, 2024" "1.3.11" "SIERRA"
.SH NAME
sierra \- reSearch pIpEline for Reproducability, Reusability, and Automation.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
This the \(dqmain menu\(dq of the SIERRA reference manual, which captures most, but
not all of its documentation. For the full experience, look at the online docs
at \fI\%https://sierra.readthedocs.io/en/master\fP\&.
.SH COMPONENTS
.sp
The following manpages are available:
.INDENT 0.0

\fBsierra\-cli\fP \- The SIERRA command line interface.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBsierra\-usage\fP \- How to use SIERRA (everything BUT the command line
interface).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBsierra\-platforms\fP \- The target platforms that SIERRA currently
supports (e.g., ARGoS).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBsierra\-exec\-envs\fP \- The target execution environments that SIERRA
currently supports (e.g., the local machine).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBsierra\-examples\fP \- Examples of SIERRA usage via command line
invocations demonstrating various features.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBsierra\-glossary\fP \- Glossary of SIERRA terminology to make things

.UNINDENT
.SH ERRORS
.sp
Generally speaking, SIERRA is very conservative, and uses lots of assert()s to
verify its internal state and the state of a given experiment at a given step of
execution before proceeding to the next step. SIERRA should rarely crash with a
cryptic interpreter error message/exception, but if it does, please report it so
I can fix it and/or create a better error message.
.sp
Errors should be reported to \fI\%https://github.com/jharwell/sierra.git\fP\&.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.sp
SIERRA will always return 0, unless it crashes with an exception or a failed
assert, in which case the return code will be non\-zero.
