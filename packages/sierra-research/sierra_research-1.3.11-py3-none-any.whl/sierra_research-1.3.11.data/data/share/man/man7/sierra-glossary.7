.TH "SIERRA-GLOSSARY" "7" "Sep 23, 2024" "1.3.11" "SIERRA"
.SH NAME
sierra-glossary \- Glossary of SIERRA terminology.
.SH GLOSSARY
.sp
SIERRA uses a number of common research\-related terms, perhaps in different ways
than you are used to. They are defined here to help demystify \fIwhy\fP SIERRA
works/is designed the way it is, and to help you find your way around.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B ARGoS
A state\-of\-the\-art multi\-physics engine robotics simulator which SIERRA
supports as a \fI\%Platform\fP\&. The ARGoS website is at
\fI\%https://www.argos\-sim.info/index.php\fP\&.
.TP
.B Gazebo
A state\-of\-the\-art robotics simulator with many features including .urdf
robot models, realistic 3D rendering, and more. The Gazebo website is at
\fI\%https://gazebosim.org\fP\&.
.TP
.B ROS1
You know it. You either love it or hate it, but you can\(aqt escape it. The
ROS website is at \fI\%https://wiki.ros.org\fP\&.
.TP
.B ROS1+Gazebo
A \fI\%Platform\fP supported by SIERRA to use \fI\%ROS1\fP with the
\fI\%Gazebo\fP simulator.
.TP
.B ROS1+Robot
A \fI\%Platform\fP supported by SIERRA using \fI\%ROS1\fP and any robot
which supports ROS.
.TP
.B Project
The SIERRA plugin allowing you to use your code on the platform of your
choice within the SIERRA framework. A project is mainly a set of \fB\&.yaml\fP
configuration files, project\-specific \fI\%Batch Criteria\fP, and some
utility classes which allow SIERRA to translate the \fB\-\-scenario\fP
argument passed on the cmdline to sets of XML changes as part of
\fI\%Experiment\fP definition.
.sp
\fBIMPORTANT:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
The parent directories of all SIERRA project plugins must
be on \fI\%SIERRA_PLUGIN_PATH\fP, or SIERRA won\(aqt be able
to find them.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBIMPORTANT:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
You can\(aqt share projects across \fI\%Platforms\fP, so if you want to be able to use your project
on ROS and ARGoS (for example), you will need to create 2
separate projects with shared python code imported into
each as needed.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Specified via \fB\-\-project\fP on the cmdline. See \fI\%Command Line Interface\fP for
documentation.
.TP
.B Tick
A timestep. In SIERRA, physics engines will perform some number of
iterations per tick, and after that the controllers for all agents will be
run.
.TP
.B Batch Criteria
A \fIvariable\fP you wish to use with SIERRA to measure its effect on system
behavior. A batch criteria can has a single axis (such as
\fI\%Population Size\fP), in which case it is
called \fIunivariate\fP, or have two axes (such as
\fI\%Population Size\fP and another batch
criteria such as one defining sensor and actuator noise to apply to the
robots), in which case it is called \fIbivariate\fP\&.
.sp
Univariate batch criteria have one dimension, and so the graphs produced
by them are (usually) linegraphs with a numerical representation of the
range for the variable on the X axis, and some other quantity of interest
on the Y.
.sp
Bivariate batch criteria have two dimensions, and so the graphs produced
by them are (usually) heatmaps with the first variable in the criteria on
the X axis, the second on the Y, and the quantity of interest on
the Z. Bivariate batch criteria are always built using univariate batch
criteria as building blocks.
.sp
The axis/axes you select as part of the batch criteria you will use to
define for \fI\%Batch Experiment\fP define the \fIsearch space\fP for your
experiment: either a 1D or 2D array of \fI\%Experiments\fP\&.
.sp
Batch criteria define a \fIrange\fP of sets changes for one or more elements
in a template \fB\&.xml\fP file (passed to SIERRA with
\fB\-\-template\-input\-file\fP). For each element in the range, the changes are
applied to the template \fB\&.xml\fP file to define
\fI\%Experiments\fP\&. The set of defined experiments is called
a \fI\%Batch Experiment\fP\&.
.sp
The batch criteria you can use depends on:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The \fI\%Project\fP you have loaded, as each project can define their
own batch criteria (see ln\-sierra\-tutorials\-project\-new\-bc).
.IP \(bu 2
The \fI\%Platform\fP you have selected, as each platform defines some
basic batch criteria that any project/experiment can use.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
SIERRA itself does not define any batch criteria.
.TP
.B Batch Experiment
A set of \fI\%Experiments\fP each defined by XML changes
generated by the selected \fI\%Batch Criteria\fP to a template \fB\&.argos\fP
file passed to SIERRA during stage 1 via \fB\-\-template\-input\-file\fP\&.
.sp
For example, for the \fI\%Population Size\fP
batch criteria, each experiment is defined by a single XML change to the
provided \fB\&.argos\fP file: the number of robots in the swarm. Depending on
the specifics you set for the \fIrange\fP of sizes you are interested in,
several experiments will be generated from the template \fB\&.argos\fP file,
each differing from the template in the configured swarm size.
.TP
.B Experiment
A single datapoint within a \fI\%Batch Experiment\fP;
that is a single value of the \fIthing\fP that you are interested in varying
across some range of experiments to see what happens (or doesn\(aqt happen).
.TP
.B Experimental Run
Meaning is \fI\%Platform\fP dependent.
.sp
For \fB\-\-platform=platform.argos\fP it is an \fI\%ARGoS\fP simulation that
runs as part of an experiment. For \fB\-\-platform=platform.ros1gazebo\fP it
is a \fI\%Gazebo\fP simulation that runs as part of an experiment.
.sp
The number of simulations which will be run by SIERRA in stage 2 and
averaged together by SIERRA in stage 3 is controlled by \fB\-\-n\-runs\fP\&.
.sp
All runs in within an \fI\%Experiment\fP are identical, with the exception
of:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
Different values for the XML changes resulting from the different
experiments they are part of, as defined by the batch criteria
generating the batch experiment.
.IP \(bu 2
Different random seeds
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B Output .csv
A CSV file generated as an output from a single \fI\%Experimental
Run\fP\&. It will (probably) contain a set of columns of representing outputs
of interest, with rows corresponding to values captured throughout the
run.
.TP
.B Averaged .csv
A CSV file generated as from averaging files from multiple
\fI\%Experimental Runs\fP\&. It will (probably) contain a
set of columns of representing outputs of interest, with rows
corresponding to values captured throughout the run (i.e., a time
series).
.TP
.B Collated .csv
A CSV file created by SIERRA during stage 4 (if inter\-experiment
graph generation is to be run). Collated CSV files contain a set
columns, one per \fI\%Experiment\fP in the \fI\%Batch Experiment\fP\&. Each
column is the captured value of a \fIsingle\fP column within an \fI\%Output
\&.csv\fP\&. This is to capture a specific aspect of the behavior of the swarm
within a batch experiment, for use in graph generation.
.TP
.B Summary .csv
A CSV file created by SIERRA during stage 4 (if inter\-experiment
graph generation is to be run). A summary CSV file created from a
\fI\%Collated .csv\fP file by taking the last row; this usually
corresponds to steady\-state behavior, which is what you are
after. However, you can also capture transient behaviors by creating
\fI\%Collated .csv\fP and \fI\%Summary .csv\fP files from captured
\fI\%Experimental Run\fP outputs over short stretches of time\-\-SIERRA does
not know the difference.
.TP
.B Inter\-Batch .csv
A CSV file created by SIERRA during stage 5. An inter\-batch CSV
is created by \(dqcollating\(dq columns from a \fI\%Summary .csv\fP present in
multiple \fI\%Batch Experiments\fP into a single
CSV. Used during stage 5.
.TP
.B Imagizing
The process of turning a text file of some kind (e.g., CSV, \fB\&.gml\fP)
into an image.
.TP
.B Platform
The \fIcontext\fP in which experiments are run: either via a simulator of some
kind, or a run\-time framework for deploying code to one or more real
robots.
.sp
\fBIMPORTANT:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
In SIERRA terminology, platform != OS. A given OS such has
linux might support multiple platforms like ARGoS, ROS,
etc, while a different OS like OSX might support only
ARGoS.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B Graph Category
A semantic label attached to a set of graphs which are similar. For
example, if you want to generate graphs about the different ways that
robots allocate tasks, you might create a \fBLN_task_alloc\fP label, so that
you can enable/disable all task allocation related graphs for one or more
controllers easily when configuring your project.
.TP
.B Controller Category
A semantic label attached to a set of controllers which are similar in
some way. For example, if you have two controllers which use the same type
of memory (say it\(aqs a \(dqlast N objects seen\(dq memory), you could create a
\fBLastN\fP category, and then define controllers within it, e.g.,
\fBLastN.Ring\fP and \fBLastN.DecayRing\fP for two controllers which have a
ringbuffer of remembered objects and a decaying ringbuffer of remembered
objects (i.e., an object is forgotten after some period of time even if it
is not forced out of the ringbuffer by seeing a new object). See
configuring your project.
.TP
.B Model
A python implementation of a theoretical model of some kind. Can use
empirical data from simulations/real robot experiments, or not, as
needed. Intended to generate predictions of \fIsomething\fP which can then be
plotted against empirical results for comparison.
.TP
.B Plugin
A python package/module living in a directory on
\fI\%SIERRA_PLUGIN_PATH\fP which contains functionality to extend SIERRA
without modifying its core (i.e., customization of different parts of the
pipeline). Plugins come in several flavors, all of which are handled
equivalently by SIERRA:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
Pipeline plugins \- Plugins which provide different ways of executing
core parts of the SIERRA pipeline (e.g., how to run experiments).
.IP \(bu 2
Platform plugins \- Plugins which correspond to different
\fI\%Platforms\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
Project  plugins \- Plugins which correspond to different
\fI\%Projects\fP\&.
