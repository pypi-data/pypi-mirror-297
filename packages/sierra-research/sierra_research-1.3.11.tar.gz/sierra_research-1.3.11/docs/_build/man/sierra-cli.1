SIERRA generally assumes/relies on all

of columns which are of equivalent length
across: term: \fIExperimental Runs < Experimental
Run >\fP (different columns within a dataframe
can of course have different lengths). This is
checked during stage 3 unless
\fB\-\-df\-skip\-verify\fP is passed. If strict
verification is skipped, then SIERRA provides
the following options when processing
dataframes during stage {3, 4} to to homogenize
them:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBnone\fP \- Don\(aqt do anything. This may or may
not produce crashes during stage 4, depending
on what you are doing.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBpad\fP \- Project last valid value in columns
which are too short down the column to make
it match those which are longer.
.sp
Note that this may result in invalid
data/graphs if the filled columns are
intervallic, interval average, or cumulative
average data. If the data is a cumulative
count of something, then this policy will
have no ill effects.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBzero\fP \- Same as \fBpad\fP, but always fill
with zeroes.

Homogenization is performed just before writing
dataframes to the specified storage
medium. Useful with real robot experiments if
the number of datapoints captured per\-robot is
slightly different, depending on when they
started executing relative to when the
experiment started.

Gazebo can group non\-interacting
entities into computational \(dqislands\(dq
and do the physics updates for those
islands in parallel each timestep
(islands) are recomputed after each
timestep). Gazebo can also parallelize
the computation of velocity/position
updates with the computation of
resolving collisions (i.e., the
timestep impulse results in one entity
\(dqinside\(dq another). You can assign
multiple threads to a pool for
cumulative use for these two
parallelization methods (threads will
be allocated evenly between them). The
point at which adding more threads will
start to DECREASE performance depends
on the complexity of your world, the
number and type of robots in it, etc.,
so don\(aqt just set this parameter to the
# of cores for your machine as a
default.
.sp
From the Gazebo Parallel Physics
Report, setting the pool size to the #
robots/# joint trees in your simulation
usually gives good results, as long as
you have more cores available than you
allocate to this pool (Gazebo has other
