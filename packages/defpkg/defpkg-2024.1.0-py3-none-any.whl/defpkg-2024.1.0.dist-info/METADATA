## defpkg - an interesting library for creating jokes in code
In this library, you can leave jokes in your code, which will help entertain those who use it. In my opinion, it's a fun and interesting solution that doesn't interfere with the code or break anything. This project is still in testing (I actually created it because I was bored). Anyway, I uploaded it before, but now I've decided to officially release it just because. 

## Installation
Installation is only available for Python 3.11 and above.
