# Overview

`modstore` brings about the speed python lacked while implementing complex `Data Structures`. `modstore` upgrades pre-existing `Data Structures` to the point you can laid back and use `pre-built` complex functions. While still keeping the base Structures, `modstore` introduces better and improves ones such as `BlockChain`, `DAG` and much more.

Leveraging `Rust`'s speed and safety, new `Data Structures` are lightning fast and gives you the comfortability of using them via `Python`.
