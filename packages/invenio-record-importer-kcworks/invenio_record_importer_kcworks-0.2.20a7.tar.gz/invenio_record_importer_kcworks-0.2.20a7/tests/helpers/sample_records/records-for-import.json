    "abstract": "The issue of gender has been a topic of discussion in the research of Hasidism since S. A. Horodecky\u2019s book (1923), in which he claimed that Hasidism brought about full equality of Jewish men and women in the field of spirituality. Although his claims have been by and large rejected, most\r\nscholars agree that the twentieth century Chabad movement has indeed created space for women in the hasidic model of spirituality. This article sets out to explore whether the particular interest of contemporary Chabad in the role of women is a new phenomenon or has existed from the movement\u2019s inception. Rather than looking at the issue from a social-historical perspective, the article examines the gender discourse conveyed in the homilies of the founder of Chabad, Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi (1745\u20131812). It explores the role of the feminine aspect of divinity in the process of creation, and its envisioned elevation in the future-to-come, in an attempt to establish the relation between the gender category of \u201cfemale\u201d and flesh-and-blood women in the teachings of Shneur Zalman of Liadi. This, in turn, leads to determine whether the concept of the transfigurations of genders in the future-to-come, a Chabad tradition that originates in the teachings of Shneur Zalman of Liadi and serves as the ideological ground for the empowerment of Chabad women in the writings of the late Lubavitcher Rebbe in the twentieth century, could have any relevance to the daily life of wives and daughters of Shneur Zalman\u2019s followers.",

    "abstract": "This chapter examines the impact of a putative oral Homer upon the work of recent performance-makers. The influence of oral-poetic theories is (as yet) an under-explored area of study, neglected by scholars whose literary expertise leads them to focus on dramatic texts and production histories, with each revisionary text or production regarded as a single, stable, and repeatable entity. The field of classical reception studies at present lacks the conceptual and theoretical means to engage effectively with works which deliberately exploit elements of \u2018in-performance\u2019 composition, and which positively value the qualities of fluidity and flexibility evoked by oral-poetic interpretations of ancient epic. However, the present work contends that a notional oral Homer informs a diverse array of contemporary theatre texts and performance practices,  and that a full appreciation of the different ways in which oral-poetic theory can influence the creation of these depends upon an ability to identify and interpret the interplay between \u2018fixed\u2019 and \u2018unfixed\u2019 elements both within particular performances, and within different iterations of the same production or event. Kate Tempest\u2019s performance-poem Brand New Ancients is analysed as a striking recent example of creative interplay between such \u2018fixed\u2019 and \u2018unfixed\u2019 elements.",

    "abstract": "These models are a representation of the macroeconomic evolution of the US economy from 1970 to 2010. The main variables addressed are economic growth, income distribution and private debt. The theoretical basis of the model relies on what Bhaduri labeled as the \"Marx-Keynes-Kalecki\" tradition that has four distinctive assumptions: 1) The price of this one-commidty model is determined by a mark-up over the production costs. 2) Aggregate demand determines (AD) the level of production (Y). 3) Investment (I) is the key variable within aggregate demand. 4) The level of aggregate supply (Yt) is equal to aggregate demand (ADt). There are other features of the model that are also worth to pinpoint. The baseline model has three sectors: workers, industrial capital and private banking. The first two sectors are clearly differentiated by the marginal propensities of their members to consume and their access to credit. Workers have a marginal propensity to consume that goes from 0.5 to 1.3. The propensity of consumption of this sector varies with respect to two macro-level \"shaping structures\" that determine this sector's microeconomic behavior. Workers' propensity to consume varies non-linearly regarding inflation, and it exhibits a positive and linear relationship with respect to the industrial capital's share on total income. On the other hand, capitalists can save or become indebted depending on the saving-investment gap. Any investment decision over savings is always financed by the acquisition of private debt provided by private banks, and the excess of savings is used to pay the debt contracted by the capitalists. Whilst the activity of private banking is limited only to the granting of credit, the accumulation of private debt represents its source of profits. A subsidiary assumption that is maintained throughout this model is that it is a closed economy without government.",

    "title": "The Paradox of Female Agency: Ophelia and East Asian Sensibilities",
    "title_unchanged": "The Paradox of Female Agency: Ophelia and East Asian Sensibilities",
    "abstract": "There are three main East Asian approaches to interpreting Ophelia. The first is informed by the fascination with and reaction against the Victorian pictorialization of Ophelia, especially John Everett Millais\u2019s famous Ophelia (1851), that emphasized, as Kimberly Rhodes describes, her \u201cpathos, innocence, and beauty rather than the unseemly detail of her death.\u201d Despite having lived through negative experiences, Ophelia retains a childlike innocence in these rewritings. For example, New Hamlet by Lao She (penname of Shu Qingchun, 1899-1966) parodies China\u2019s \u201cHamlet complex\u201d (the inability to act at a time of national crisis) and the fascination with an Ophelia submerged in water. Both Ophelia and Millais\u2019s painting are featured in two of Japanese writer Natsume S\u014dseki\u2019s early twentieth-century novels. A second approach emphasizes the local context. Adapters used local values to engage with and even critique the Victorian narrative tradition of moralization. Late nineteenth-century translator Lin Shu (1852-1924), for example, tones down the sentimentalization of Ophelia in his classical Chinese rewriting of Charles and Mary Lamb\u2019s Tales from Shakespeare, showcasing the conflict between Victorian and Confucian moral codes. The third approach focuses upon an objectified and sexualized Ophelia. As other chapters in this volume demonstrate, this is not exclusively an Asian phenomenon. However, the eroticism associated with the Ophelia figure in a number of Asian stage and screen versions of Hamlet, such as Sherwood Hu\u2019s film Prince of the Himalayas (2006), aligns Ophelia with East Asian ideals of femininity, but also brings out the sexuality that is latent or suppressed in Victorian interpretations. They do so by aligning Ophelia with East Asian ideals of femininity.",

    "abstract": "Traditional towns in Portugal and Brazil have evolved a finely tuned coordination between, on the one hand, modular dimensions for street widths and lot sizes, and on the other, a typology of room shapes and layouts within houses. Despite being well documented in urban history, this coordination was in the last century often interpreted as contingent, a result of the limited material means of pre-industrial societies. But the continued application and gradual adaptation of these urban and architectural patterns through periods of industrialization and economic development suggests that they respond both to enduring housing requirements and to piecemeal urban growth. This article surveys the persistence of urban and architectural patterns up to the early 20th century, showing their resilience in addressing modern housing and urbanization requirements.",
