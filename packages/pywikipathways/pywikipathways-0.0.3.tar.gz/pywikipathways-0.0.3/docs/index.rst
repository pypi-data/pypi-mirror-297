Welcome to pywikipathways documentation!
========================================

Use this package to interface with the WikiPathways API. It provides programmatic access to WikiPathways content.

This is a Python port of `rWikiPathways R (Bioconductor) package <http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/rWikiPathways.html>`_. The names of functions and their arguments are unified between the two. (However, there is a difference between a camel case and a snake case.)

This project is inspired by `py4cytoscape <https://github.com/cytoscape/py4cytoscape>`_ for `RCy3 Bioconductor package <https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/RCy3.html>`_. Just as py4cytoscape ports RCy3 and function specifications to Python, pywikipathways also ports rWikiPathways functions to Python.
