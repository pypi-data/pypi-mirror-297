# pywikipathways
Python Client Package for the WikiPathways API

Use this package to interface with the WikiPathways API.
It provides programmatic access to WikiPathways content.

This is a Python port of [rWikiPathways](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/rWikiPathways.html) R (Bioconductor) package.
The names of functions and their arguments are unified between the two.
(However, there is a difference between a camel case and a snake case.)

This project is inspired by [py4cytoscape](https://github.com/cytoscape/py4cytoscape) for [RCy3](https://github.com/cytoscape/RCy3).
Just as py4cytoscape ports RCy3 and function specifications to Python, pywikipathways also ports rWikiPathways functions to Python.
