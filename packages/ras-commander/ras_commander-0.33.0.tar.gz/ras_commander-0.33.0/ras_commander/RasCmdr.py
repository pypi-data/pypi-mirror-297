"""
Execution operations for running HEC-RAS simulations using subprocess.
Based on the HEC-Commander project's "Command Line is All You Need" approach, leveraging the -c compute flag to run HEC-RAS and orchestrating changes directly in the RAS input files to achieve automation outcomes.

# TO DO: 
# 1. Alternate Run Mode for compute_plan and compute_parallel:  Using Powershell to execute the HEC-RAS command and hide the RAS window and all child windows.
#    If this is implemented, and the plan has a popup, then the plan will not execute.  This is a deal breaker for many scenarios, and should only be used
#    as a special option for those who don't want to deal with the popups, or want to run in the background.  This option should be limited to non-commercial use.
# 2. Implment compute_plan_remote to go along with compute_plan.  This will be a compute_plan that is run on a remote machine via a psexec command.
#    First, we will use the keyring package to securely store the remote machine username and password.
#    Second, we will implement the psexec command to execute the HEC-RAS command on the remote machine.
#    Each machine will need to be initialized as a remote_worker object, which will store the machine name, username, password, ras_exe_path, local folder path and other relevant info.
#    A separate RasRemote class will be created to handle the creation of the remote_worker objects and the necessary abstractions. 
#    The compute_plan_remote function will live in RasCmdr, and will be a thin abstraction above the RasRemote class, since the functions will be simliar to the existing compute_plan functions, but specific to remote execution.

        Notes:
            - This function creates separate folders for each worker to ensure isolated execution.
            - Each worker uses its own RAS object to prevent conflicts.
            - Plans are distributed among workers using a queue to ensure efficient parallel processing.
            - The function automatically handles cleanup and consolidation of results after execution.
        
        Revision Notes:
            - Added support for clear_geompre flag as a pass-through to compute_plan.
            - Simplified worker thread logic by removing redundant operations.
            - Removed duplicate RAS object initialization in worker threads.

        Execute HEC-RAS plans in test mode.  This is a re-creation of the HEC-RAS command line -test flag, 
        which does not work in recent versions of HEC-RAS.
        
        As a special-purpose function that emulates the original -test flag, it operates differently than the 
        other two compute_ functions.  Per the original HEC-RAS test flag, it creates a separate test folder,
        copies the project there, and executes the specified plans in sequential order.
        
        For most purposes, just copying a the project folder, initing that new folder, then running each plan 
        with compute_plan is a simpler and more flexible approach.  This is shown in the examples provided
        in the ras-commander library.

        Args:
            plan_number (str, list[str], optional): Plan number or list of plan numbers to execute. 
                If None, all plans will be executed. Default is None.
            dest_folder_suffix (str, optional): Suffix to append to the test folder name to create dest_folder. 
                Defaults to "[Test]".
                dest_folder is always created in the project folder's parent directory.
            clear_geompre (bool, optional): Whether to clear geometry preprocessor files.
                Defaults to False.
            num_cores (int, optional): Maximum number of cores to use for each plan.
                If None, the current setting is not changed. Default is None.
            ras_object (RasPrj, optional): Specific RAS object to use. If None, uses the global ras instance.
            overwrite_dest (bool, optional): If True, overwrite the destination folder if it exists. Defaults to False.

        Returns:
            None

        Example:
            Run all plans: RasCommander.compute_test_mode()
            Run a specific plan: RasCommander.compute_test_mode(plan_number="01")
            Run multiple plans: RasCommander.compute_test_mode(plan_number=["01", "03", "05"])
            Run plans with a custom folder suffix: RasCommander.compute_test_mode(dest_folder_suffix="[TestRun]")
            Run plans and clear geometry preprocessor files: RasCommander.compute_test_mode(clear_geompre=True)
            Run plans with a specific number of cores: RasCommander.compute_test_mode(num_cores=4)
            
        Notes:
            - This function executes plans in a separate folder for isolated testing.
            - If plan_number is not provided, all plans in the project will be executed.
            - The function does not change the geometry preprocessor and IB tables settings.  
                - To force recomputing of geometry preprocessor and IB tables, use the clear_geompre=True option.
            - Plans are executed sequentially.
            - Because copying the project is implicit, only a dest_folder_suffix option is provided.
            - For more flexible run management, use the compute_parallel or compute_sequential functions.
