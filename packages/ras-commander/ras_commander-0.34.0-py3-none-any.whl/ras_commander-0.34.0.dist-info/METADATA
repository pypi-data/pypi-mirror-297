# RAS Commander (ras-commander)

RAS Commander is a Python library for automating HEC-RAS operations, providing a set of tools to interact with HEC-RAS project files, execute simulations, and manage project data. This library is an evolution of the RASCommander 1.0 Python Notebook Application previously released under the [HEC-Commander tools repository](https://github.com/billk-FM/HEC-Commander).

## Background
The ras-commander library emerged from the initial test-bed of AI-driven coding represented by the HEC-Commander tools Python notebooks. These notebooks served as a proof of concept, demonstrating the value proposition of automating HEC-RAS operations. The transition from notebooks to a structured library aims to provide a more robust, maintainable, and extensible solution for water resources engineers.

## Features

- Automate HEC-RAS project management and simulations
- Support for both single and multiple project instances
- Parallel execution of HEC-RAS plans
- Utilities for managing geometry, plan, and unsteady flow files
- Example project management for testing and development
- Two primary operation modes: "Run Missing" and "Build from DSS"

## AI-Driven Coding Experience

ras-commander provides several AI-powered tools to enhance the coding experience:

1. **ChatGPT Assistant: [RAS Commander Library Assistant](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-TZRPR3oAO-ras-commander-library-assistant)**: A specialized GPT model trained on the ras-commander codebase, available for answering queries and providing code suggestions.

2. **[Purpose-Built Knowledge Base Summaries](https://github.com/billk-FM/ras-commander/tree/main/ai_tools/assistant_knowledge_bases)**: Up-to-date compilations of the documentation and codebase for use with large language models like Claude or GPT-4. Look in 'ai_tools/assistant_knowledge_bases/' in the repo.

3. **[Cursor IDE Integration](https://github.com/billk-FM/ras-commander/blob/main/.cursorrules)**: Custom rules for the Cursor IDE to provide context-aware suggestions and documentation.  Just open the repository folder in Cursor.  You can create your own folders "/workspace/, "/projects/", or "my_projects/" as these are already in the .gitignore, and place your custom scripts there for your projects.  This will allow easy referencing of the ras-commander documents and individual repo files, the automatic loading of the .cursorrules file.  Alternatvely, download the github repo into your projects folder to easily load documents and use cursor rules files.  
4. **[AI Assistant Notebook](https://github.com/billk-FM/ras-commander/blob/main/ai_tools/rascommander_code_assistant.ipynb)**: A notebook for dynamic code summarization and API interaction (bring your own API Key).  Currently, this only does a single-shot message on the Claude Sonnet 3.5 API, which can be up to 50 cents per request.  Future revisions will include the ability to select which knowledge base file to include, a choice of SOTA models + multi turn conversations to build automation notebooks interactively.  

These tools aim to streamline development and provide intelligent assistance when modeling with, and working with and revising the ras-commander library.

## Installation

Create a virtual environment with conda or venv (ask ChatGPT if you need help)

In your virtual environment, install ras-commander using pip:
```
pip install pandas requests pathlib
pip install ras-commander
```

   

## Requirements

- Tested with Python 3.11
- HEC-RAS 6.2 or later (other versions may work, all testing was done with version 6.2 and above)
- Detailed project workflows and/or existing libraries and code where ras-commander can be integrated.

For a full list of dependencies, see the `requirements.txt` file.

## Quick Start
```
from ras_commander import init_ras_project, RasCmdr, RasPlan
```

# Initialize a project
```
init_ras_project(r"/path/to/project", "6.5")
```

# Execute a single plan
```
RasCmdr.compute_plan("01", dest_folder=r"/path/to/results", overwrite_dest=True)
```

# Execute plans in parallel
```
results = RasCmdr.compute_parallel(
    plan_numbers=["01", "02"],
    max_workers=2,
    cores_per_run=2,
    dest_folder=r"/path/to/results",
    overwrite_dest=True
)
```

# Modify a plan
```
RasPlan.set_geom("01", "02")
```

## Key Components

- `RasPrj`: Manages HEC-RAS projects
- `RasCmdr`: Handles execution of HEC-RAS simulations
- `RasPlan`: Provides functions for modifying and updating plan files
- `RasGeo`: Handles operations related to geometry files
- `RasUnsteady`: Manages unsteady flow file operations
- `RasUtils`: Contains utility functions for file operations and data management
- `RasExamples`: Manages and loads HEC-RAS example projects

## Accessing HEC Examples through RasExamples

The `RasExamples` class provides functionality for quickly loading and managing HEC-RAS example projects. This is particularly useful for testing and development purposes.

Key features:
- Download and extract HEC-RAS example projects
- List available project categories and projects
- Extract specific projects for use
- Manage example project data efficiently

Example usage:
from ras_commander import RasExamples

```
ras_examples = RasExamples()
ras_examples.get_example_projects()  # Downloads example projects if not already present
categories = ras_examples.list_categories()
projects = ras_examples.list_projects("Steady Flow")
extracted_paths = ras_examples.extract_project(["Bald Eagle Creek", "Muncie"])
```


## RasPrj

The `RasPrj` class is central to managing HEC-RAS projects within the ras-commander library. It handles project initialization, data loading, and provides access to project components.

Key features:
- Initialize HEC-RAS projects
- Load and manage project data (plans, geometries, flows, etc.)
- Provide easy access to project files and information

Note: While a global `ras` object is available for convenience, you can create multiple `RasPrj` instances to manage several projects simultaneously.

Example usage:
```
from ras_commander import RasPrj, init_ras_project
```

### Using the global ras object
```
init_ras_project("/path/to/project", "6.5")
```

### Creating a custom RasPrj instance
```
custom_project = RasPrj()
init_ras_project("/path/to/another_project", "6.5", ras_instance=custom_project)
```

## Acknowledgments

RAS Commander is based on the HEC-Commander project's "Command Line is All You Need" approach, leveraging the HEC-RAS command-line interface for automation. The initial development of this library was presented in the HEC-Commander Tools repository.  In a 2024 Australian Water School webinar, Bill demonstrated the derivation of basic HEC-RAS automation functions from plain language instructions. Leveraging the previously developed code and AI tools, the library was created. The primary tools used for this initial development were Anthropic's Claude, GPT-4o, Google's Gemini Experimental models, and the Cursor AI Coding IDE.
