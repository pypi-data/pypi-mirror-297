## About

PyCCEA is an evolving open-source Python package aimed at solving feature selection problems using cooperative co-evolutionary strategies. The package is designed to assist in high-dimensional problems by leveraging a flexible, decomposition-based approach. Currently, **PyCCEA is a work in progress** and is being developed as part of my doctoral research. Once complete, it will offer a robust solution for researchers and practitioners working with large-scale feature selection problems. Stay tuned for updates!

## Installation

To install the package directly from the GitHub repository, run the following command:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/pedbrgs/pyccea.git
```

Make sure you have `pip` installed and an active internet connection to fetch the package.
