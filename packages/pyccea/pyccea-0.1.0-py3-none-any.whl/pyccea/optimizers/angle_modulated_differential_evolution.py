    Attributes
    ----------
    scaling_factor: float
        The mutation constant. In the literature this is also known as differential weight,
        being denoted by F. It should be in the range [0, 2].
    crossover_probability: float
        The recombination constant, should be in the range [0, 1]. In the literature this is
        also known as the crossover probability. Increasing this value allows a larger number
        of mutants to progress into the next generation, but at the risk of population
        stability.
    bounds: tuple[float, float], default (-1, 1)
        Bounds for coefficients (min, max).
    n_coeffs: int, default 4
        Number of coefficients in the angle modulation function. The AMDE evolves values for
        the four coefficients, a, b, c, and d. The first coefficient represents the horizontal
        shift of the function, the second coefficient represents the maximum frequency of the
        sine function, the third coefficient represents the frequency of the cosine function,
        and the fourth coefficient represents the vertical shift of the function.
