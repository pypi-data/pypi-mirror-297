# MkSlides-Reveal

> Use `mkslides-reveal` to easily turn markdown files into beautiful slides using the power of [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/)!

[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/mkslides-reveal)](https://pypi.org/project/mkslides-reveal/)

[MkSlides-Reveal](https://pypi.org/project/mkslides-reveal/) is a static site generator that's geared towards building slideshows. Slideshow source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file. The workflow and commands are heavily inspired by [MkDocs](https://pypi.org/project/mkdocs/) and [reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md).

## Features

-   Build static HTML slideshow files from Markdown files.
    -   Turn a single Markdown file into a HTML slideshow.
    -   Turn a folder with Markdown files into a collection of HTML slideshows.
-   Publish your slideshow(s) anywhere that static files can be served.
    -   Locally
    -   On a webserver
    -   Deploy through CI/CD with GitHub/GitLab (like this repo!)
-   Preview your site as you work, thanks to [python-livereload](https://pypi.org/project/livereload/).
-   Use custom favicons, CSS themes, templates, ... if desired.
-   Support for emojis :smile: :tada: :rocket: :sparkles: thanks to [emoji](https://github.com/carpedm20/emoji/)
-   Depends heavily on integration/unit tests to prevent regressions.
-   And more!

## Installation

```bash
pip install mkslides-reveal
```

## Create static site

E.g. when your Markdown files are located in the `docs/` folder:

```bash
mkslides-reveal build docs/
```

E.g. when you have a single Markdown file called `test.md`:

```bash
mkslides-reveal build test.md
```

## Live preview

```bash
mkslides-reveal serve docs/
```

```bash
mkslides-reveal serve test.md
```

Just create a `mkslides.yml`. All options are optional, you only have to add what you want to change to `mkslides.yml`.

Here's an example:

```yml

    title: example-title
    favicon: ./example-index-favicon.ico
    theme: example-index-theme.css
