# shopen

shopen is a proper implementation of os.startfile to launch a target file/URL. Use it to launch the
preferred system viewer for the user to view or edit a target file or URL.

"shopen" is short for `shutil.open`, the [proposed builtin](
https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/47427) it's intended to be a reference implementation for.

## Usage

Simply install as a dependency of your project and then use it to launch an opener for a file or
URL:

```python
import pathlib, shopen
shopen.open("https://zombo.com/")  # Opens web browser
shopen.open(pathlib.Path("~/somefile.txt").expanduser())  # Opens file viewer
shopen.open(pathlib.Path("./somefile.toml"), "edit")  # Opens editor
```

## Why?

Python's standard library provides nice cross-platform utilites for lots of different purposes, but
so far no simple file/URL opener that would work on all platforms.

On Windows there's [os.startfile], but strangely that doesn't support any other platform.

The proposal [python/cpython#47427](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/47427) to implement it
as `shutil.open` was rejected for now. Python users keep [asking](
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/434597/open-document-with-default-os-application-in-python-both-in-windows-and-mac-os)
for a decent way to do it, but the only answer had been brittle copypastaâ€¦ until now!

Ideally this can be added into stdlib after proving its usefulness and then only be needed as a
polyfill for older versions of python.
