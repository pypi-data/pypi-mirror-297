Scrape into a large bowl and stir in the softened onion, pistachios, cranberries, apricots and parsley. Season with nutmeg, lots of black pepper and some salt. Grease a deep, 20cm round springform or loose-bottomed tin, then line with baking parchment. To make the pastry, mix together the flours and 2 tsp salt in a large bowl, then make a well in the centre. Put the butter and lard into a small pan with 200ml water and very gently melt. Once melted, turn up the heat and when just bubbling, pour into the well and stir with a wooden spoon to a dough – don’t worry if some powdery bits remain. Once cool enough to handle, knead in the bowl until the dough comes together, then tip onto your work surface. Set aside a third, wrapped in a clean tea towel to keep it as warm and pliable as possible, while you quickly roll the remaining dough into a large circle – big enough to line the tin with a little overhanging. Ease the circle into the tin, pressing evenly into the corners and side – you can be rough with it. Evenly cover the base with half the remaining sliced ham, followed by half the chicken breasts and half the mince mixture, pressing firmly to pack. Repeat with the remaining ham and chicken, then a rounded dome of mince. Put a pie funnel, if you have one, on the top. Roll the reserved dough to a circle large enough to easily cover the pie, cutting out a hole (if using a pie funnel). Brush the edge of the pie with some beaten egg and top with the pastry lid. Press to seal the edges before trimming the excess. Crimp the edges between your thumb and forefinger to seal thoroughly, then make a small hole in the middle to let steam escape (if not using a pie funnel). Brush the top of the pie with more beaten egg. Heat oven to 200C/180 fan/gas 6. Bake the pie for 1 hr. Very, very carefully remove the pie from its tin, brush the top and side with more egg and bake for another 30 mins until browned and crisp. Leave to cool completely before chilling. To make the jelly, soak the gelatine in cold water for 5-10 mins until soft. Squeeze out any excess water from the gelatine, then dissolve in the hot stock. Once cooled, carefully pour into your chilled pie through the small hole, using a funnel, until full – you may not need all the stock. Chill the pie for a few hrs.

Bring the milk, cream, garlic, herbs and some seasoning to the boil in a large saucepan, then turn down the heat and simmer for a few mins. Slip the potatoes into the hot milk mixture and simmer for 10 mins until just cooked. Drain the potatoes in a colander over a bowl to catch the liquid – reserve the milk. While the potatoes are simmering, heat half the butter in a frying pan until foaming. Fry the mushrooms for 2 mins until just wilted, season with salt and pepper and set aside. Rub 2 small gratin dishes (or 1 medium) with the remaining butter, sprinkle over the thyme leaves and grate over some of the cheese. Fill the dishes halfway with potato slices, moisten with a little milk and grate over more cheese. Fill up the dishes with potato slices, add enough milk to cover, then top with the mushrooms and the rest of the cheese. For the chicken, mix about two-thirds of the butter with the lemon zest and half the juice, the parsley, paprika and some salt and pepper. Lift the skin slightly away from each breast, spread or pipe the flavoured butter under the skin, then stretch the skin back over. Chill up to a day in advance, if you like. Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Heat the remaining butter in an ovenproof frying pan until foaming. Pan-fry the chicken, basting constantly with the butter until starting to brown. Add the shallot, garlic, thyme and stock. Place the chicken, skin-side up in its pan, on the higher shelf of the oven, and the gratins on the lower shelf. Roast both for 25-30 mins, then remove the chicken and rest for 15 mins, while the gratins continue to cook. To finish, remove the chicken from the pan. Place the pan back on the heat, squeeze over the remaining lemon juice and bring everything to a hard boil. Pass the sauce through a sieve, pressing down firmly on all the soft shallot and garlic. Heat a drizzle of olive oil in another frying pan and reheat the leeks until they start to colour. With the gratins cooked, you are now ready to plate up. Line six leeks up in a row in the middle of each plate. Carve the chicken on a slant into five thick slices. Neatly fan out each chicken breast over the leeks.

Transfer the mixture to a food processor, reserve 200g of the butter and add the rest to the processor. Blend everything to a smooth paste. Season to taste, then spoon into 4 x 70ml clip-top jars. Melt the reserved butter in a medium frying pan and add the sliced garlic. Turn the garlic in the butter until slightly golden. Pour into the 4 jars of pâté, ensuring a few slices of garlic and the remaining thyme leaves go in each jar, and chill in the fridge for at least 4 hrs, or until set. Can be made up to 2 days in advance. Before serving, toast the brioche, then cut into triangular quarters for serving. Stir the diced apple through the chutney. Serve the pâté on small wooden boards with the toasted brioche, cornichons and chutney.",
