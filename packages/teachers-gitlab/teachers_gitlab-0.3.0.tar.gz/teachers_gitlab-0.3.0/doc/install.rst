Installation
============

The following command will install `teachers_gitlab` command to a
system-wide installation directory (installation in a virtual environment
is also possible, see development notes, please).

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install teachers-gitlab

Note: we use modern `pyproject.toml`-based installation that is not possible
with older versions of `pip`. We highly recommend to first upgrade pip to
latest version (version as old as `pip install pip==22.0` seems to work)
and then execute the above command.
