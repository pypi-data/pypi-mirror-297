Getting GitLab API token
========================

The API token is required for authenticating to GitLab and replaces the
traditional pair of username + password.

The API token is generated by GitLab itself, you only need to ask for creation
of a new one.

Go to your user configuration page (usually through your avatar icon) and
select *Access Tokens* (or visit ``/-/user_settings/personal_access_tokens``).

Use the *Add new token* to create a new token. You will need *api* scope for
this application to be selected. The new token is then ready to be copied.

Note that once you leave the page with the new token, you will not be able
to copy the token again (but you can generate as many tokens as you need).
