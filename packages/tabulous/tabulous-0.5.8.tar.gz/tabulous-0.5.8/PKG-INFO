|![](https://github.com/hanjinliu/tabulous/blob/main/image/sort_example.png)|![](https://github.com/hanjinliu/tabulous/blob/main/image/filter_example.png)|

You can apply pre-defined or custom sorting/filtering functions to tables.
Data edition during sorting/filtering is also supported.

#### Command palette

Couldn't find how to do it? Open the command palette and search for it!

#### Excel-like referenced in-cell evaluation

![](https://github.com/hanjinliu/tabulous/blob/main/image/eval_example.png)

Call `numpy` and `pandas` functions directly in cells.

#### Rich visualization

![](https://github.com/hanjinliu/tabulous/blob/main/image/colormap_example.png)

Set colormaps that will help you to browse table data.

#### Custom widget integration

Add your own `PyQt`/`magicgui` widgets to the application.
