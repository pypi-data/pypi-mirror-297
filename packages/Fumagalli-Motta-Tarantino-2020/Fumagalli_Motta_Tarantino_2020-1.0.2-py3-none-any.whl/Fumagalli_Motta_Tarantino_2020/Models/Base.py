    There are three players in our game: an Antitrust Authority (AA), which at the beginning of the game decides its
    merger policy; a monopolist $\t{I}$ncumbent; and a $\t{S}$tart-up. The start-up owns a “prototype” (or project)
    that, if developed, can give rise to an innovation: for instance a substitute/higher quality product to the
    incumbent’s existing product, or a more efficient production process. The start-up does not have enough own
    resources to develop the project. It has two options: it can either obtain additional funds from competitive
    capital markets, or sell out to the incumbent. The incumbent will have to decide whether and when it wants to
    acquire the start-up (and if it does so before product development, it has to decide whether to develop the
    prototype or shelve it), conditional on the AA’s approval of the acquisition. We assume that the takeover
    involves a negligible but positive transaction cost. The AA commits at the beginning of the game to a merger
    policy, in the form of a maximum threshold of “harm”, that it is ready to tolerate. Harm from a proposed merger
    consists of the difference between the expected welfare levels if the merger goes ahead, and in the counterfactual
    where it does not take place (derived of course by correctly anticipating the continuation equilibrium of the
    game). A proposed merger will be prohibited only if the tolerated harm level H is lower than the expected harm
    from the merger, if any.

    Timing of the game:
