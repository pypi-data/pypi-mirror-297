<p>Email-only authentication for FastAPI webapps.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Authbase a provides authentication for FastAPI/SQLAlchemy webapps.</p>
<p>It doesn't use passwords for authentication, instead it relies on users
clicking a link that was sent to their email address. The logic behind this is
that usually there is a reset password option that sends an email anyway, so in
theory it is a system that has the same or a similar level of security.</p>
<p>AuthBase also provides a function for emailing users.</p>

<section id="setup">
<h2>Setup</h2>
<pre><code>pip install authbase
</code></pre>
<p>Then in your FastAPI webapp:</p>
<pre><code>from fastapi import FastAPI
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from authbase import setup_authbase

app = FastAPI()
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///example.db')
get_user = setup_authbase(app, engine)

# ... the rest of your code goes here ...
</code></pre>
<p>The return value <strong>get_user</strong> is a function that takes a request object and
returns the currently logged in user, or None if they aren't logged in.</p>
<p>After that, edit config.py in the root directory of your project to contain:</p>
<pre><code># Name of your webapp.
WEBAPP_NAME='My Example App'

# Email settings.
SMTP_HOST='smtp.example.org'
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USERNAME='username'
SMTP_PASSWORDD='password'
SENDER_ADDRESS='My Example App &lt;no-reply@example.org&gt;'

# Redirct URL where users are sent after they successfully confirm their email
# address or sign in.
REDIRECT_URL='https://example.org/signed-in'
</code></pre>

<h2>API</h2>
<h3>POST /auth</h3>
<p>Signs up a new user or initiates the sign in process.</p>
<p>This endpoint takes a single parameter, <strong>email</strong>, which should be the email
address of the user signing up or signing in.</p>
<p>The response is HTML with a message instructing the user to check their email
for a confirmation link or a link to sign in.</p>
<p>The response sets a <strong>session_id</strong> cookie.</p>
<p>Here's an example JS snippet that you can attach to a form submit event:</p>
<pre><code>const form = document.getElementById("my-sign-in-form")
form.addEventListener("submit", event =&gt; {
    event.preventDefault();
    const formData = new FormData(event.currentTarget);
    fetch("https://api.example.org/auth", {
        method: "POST",
        body: formData,
        credentials: "include",
    }).then(... handle response ...);
});
</code></pre>
<h3>POST /sign_out</h3>
<p>This endpoint takes no parameters and signs out the user associated with the
<strong>session_id</strong> cookie.</p>
<p>Here's an example JS snippet that makes this request:</p>
<pre><code>await fetch('https://api.example.org/sign_out', {
    method: 'POST',
    credentials: 'include',
}); 
</code></pre>
<h3>GET /me</h3>
<p>Gets information about the currently signed in user.</p>
<p>The request should send the <strong>session_id</strong> cookie.</p>
<p>The response is A JSON object with two fields, <strong>id</strong>, and <strong>email_address</strong>.</p>
<p>This response returns error 401 (Unauthenticated) if the user has not signed in.</p>
<p>Here's an example JS snippet that makes this request:</p>
<pre><code>fetch('https://api.example.org/me', {
    method: 'GET',
    credentials: 'include',
}).then(... handle response ...);
</code></pre>
<h3>GET /sign_in/{secret}</h3>
<p>This endpoint is for internal use only.</p>
