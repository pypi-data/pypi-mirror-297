    The matrix w_tilde is a matrix of dimensions [image_pixels, image_pixels] that encodes the PSF convolution of
    every pair of image pixels given the noise map. This can be used to efficiently compute the curvature matrix via
    the mappings between image and source pixels, in a way that omits having to perform the PSF convolution on every

    When w_tilde is used to perform an inversion, the mapping matrices are not computed, meaning that they cannot be
    used to compute the data vector. This method creates the vector `w_tilde_data` which allows for the data
    vector to be computed efficiently without the mapping matrix.

    The matrix w_tilde_data is dimensions [image_pixels] and encodes the PSF convolution with the `weight_map`,
    where the weights are the image-pixel values divided by the noise-map values squared:

    """
    The matrix w_tilde is a matrix of dimensions [unmasked_image_pixels, unmasked_image_pixels] that encodes the
    NUFFT of every pair of image pixels given the noise map. This can be used to efficiently compute the curvature
    matrix via the mapping matrix, in a way that omits having to perform the NUFFT on every individual source pixel.
    This provides a significant speed up for inversions of interferometer datasets with large number of visibilities.
    The limitation of this matrix is that the dimensions of [image_pixels, image_pixels] can exceed many 10s of GB's,
    making it impossible to store in memory and its use in linear algebra calculations extremely. This methods creates
    a preload matrix that can compute the matrix w_tilde via an efficient preloading scheme which exploits the
    symmetries in the NUFFT.
    To compute w_tilde, one first defines a real space mask where every False entry is an unmasked pixel which is
    used in the calculation, for example:
        IxIxIxIxIxIxIxIxIxIxI
        IxIxIxIxIxIxIxIxIxIxI     This is an imaging.Mask2D, where:
        IxIxIxIxIxIxIxIxIxIxI
        IxIxIxIxIxIxIxIxIxIxI     x = `True` (Pixel is masked and excluded from lens)
        IxIxIxIoIoIoIxIxIxIxI     o = `False` (Pixel is not masked and included in lens)
        IxIxIxIoIoIoIxIxIxIxI
        IxIxIxIoIoIoIxIxIxIxI
        IxIxIxIxIxIxIxIxIxIxI
        IxIxIxIxIxIxIxIxIxIxI
        IxIxIxIxIxIxIxIxIxIxI
    Here, there are 9 unmasked pixels. Indexing of each unmasked pixel goes from the top-left corner right and
    downwards, therefore:
        IxIxIxIxIxIxIxIxIxIxI
        IxIxIxIxIxIxIxIxIxIxI
        IxIxIxIxIxIxIxIxIxIxI
        IxIxIxIxIxIxIxIxIxIxI
        IxIxIxI0I1I2IxIxIxIxI
        IxIxIxI3I4I5IxIxIxIxI
        IxIxIxI6I7I8IxIxIxIxI
        IxIxIxIxIxIxIxIxIxIxI
        IxIxIxIxIxIxIxIxIxIxI
        IxIxIxIxIxIxIxIxIxIxI
    In the standard calculation of `w_tilde` it is a matrix of
    dimensions [unmasked_image_pixels, unmasked_pixel_images], therefore for the example mask above it would be
    dimensions [9, 9]. One performs a double for loop over `unmasked_image_pixels`, using the (y,x) spatial offset
    between every possible pair of unmasked image pixels to precompute values that depend on the properties of the NUFFT.
    This calculation has a lot of redundancy, because it uses the (y,x) *spatial offset* between the image pixels. For
    example, if two image pixel are next to one another by the same spacing the same value will be computed via the
    NUFFT. For the example mask above:

    - The value precomputed for pixel pair [0,1] is the same as pixel pairs [1,2], [3,4], [4,5], [6,7] and [7,9].

    - The value precomputed for pixel pair [0,3] is the same as pixel pairs [1,4], [2,5], [3,6], [4,7] and [5,8].

    - The values of pixels paired with themselves are also computed repeatedly for the standard calculation (e.g. 9
      times using the mask above).

    The `w_tilde_preload` method instead only computes each value once. To do this, it stores the preload values in a
    matrix of dimensions [shape_masked_pixels_y, shape_masked_pixels_x, 2], where `shape_masked_pixels` is the (y,x)
    size of the vertical and horizontal extent of unmasked pixels, e.g. the spatial extent over which the real space
    grid extends.
    Each entry in the matrix `w_tilde_preload[:,:,0]` provides the precomputed NUFFT value mapping an image pixel
    to a pixel offset by that much in the y and x directions, for example:

    - w_tilde_preload[0,0,0] gives the precomputed values of image pixels that are offset in the y direction by 0 and
      in the x direction by 0 - the values of pixels paired with themselves.

    - w_tilde_preload[1,0,0] gives the precomputed values of image pixels that are offset in the y direction by 1 and
      in the x direction by 0 - the values of pixel pairs [0,3], [1,4], [2,5], [3,6], [4,7] and [5,8]

    - w_tilde_preload[0,1,0] gives the precomputed values of image pixels that are offset in the y direction by 0 and
      in the x direction by 1 - the values of pixel pairs [0,1], [1,2], [3,4], [4,5], [6,7] and [7,9].

    Flipped pairs:

    The above preloaded values pair all image pixel NUFFT values when a pixel is to the right and / or down of the
    first image pixel. However, one must also precompute pairs where the paired pixel is to the left of the host
    pixels. These pairings are stored in `w_tilde_preload[:,:,1]`, and the ordering of these pairings is flipped in the
    x direction to make it straight forward to use this matrix when computing w_tilde.

    In the standard calculation of `w_tilde` it is a matrix of
    dimensions [unmasked_image_pixels, unmasked_pixel_images], therefore for the example mask above it would be
    dimensions [9, 9]. One performs a double for loop over `unmasked_image_pixels`, using the (y,x) spatial offset
    between every possible pair of unmasked image pixels to precompute values that depend on the properties of the NUFFT.

    This calculation has a lot of redundancy, because it uses the (y,x) *spatial offset* between the image pixels. For
    example, if two image pixel are next to one another by the same spacing the same value will be computed via the
    NUFFT. For the example mask above:

    - The value precomputed for pixel pair [0,1] is the same as pixel pairs [1,2], [3,4], [4,5], [6,7] and [7,9].
    - The value precomputed for pixel pair [0,3] is the same as pixel pairs [1,4], [2,5], [3,6], [4,7] and [5,8].
    - The values of pixels paired with themselves are also computed repeatedly for the standard calculation (e.g. 9
    times using the mask above).

    The `w_tilde_preload` method instead only computes each value once. To do this, it stores the preload values in a
    matrix of dimensions [shape_masked_pixels_y, shape_masked_pixels_x, 2], where `shape_masked_pixels` is the (y,x)
    size of the vertical and horizontal extent of unmasked pixels, e.g. the spatial extent over which the real space
    grid extends.

    Each entry in the matrix `w_tilde_preload[:,:,0]` provides the precomputed NUFFT value mapping an image pixel
    to a pixel offset by that much in the y and x directions, for example:

    - w_tilde_preload[0,0,0] gives the precomputed values of image pixels that are offset in the y direction by 0 and
    in the x direction by 0 - the values of pixels paired with themselves.
    - w_tilde_preload[1,0,0] gives the precomputed values of image pixels that are offset in the y direction by 1 and
    in the x direction by 0 - the values of pixel pairs [0,3], [1,4], [2,5], [3,6], [4,7] and [5,8]
    - w_tilde_preload[0,1,0] gives the precomputed values of image pixels that are offset in the y direction by 0 and
    in the x direction by 1 - the values of pixel pairs [0,1], [1,2], [3,4], [4,5], [6,7] and [7,9].

    Returns the curvature matrix `F` (see Warren & Dye 2003) by computing it using `w_tilde_preload`
    (see `w_tilde_preload_interferometer_from`) for an interferometer inversion.

    To compute the curvature matrix via w_tilde the following matrix multiplication is normally performed:

    curvature_matrix = mapping_matrix.T * w_tilde * mapping matrix

    This function speeds this calculation up in two ways:

    1) Instead of using `w_tilde` (dimensions [image_pixels, image_pixels] it uses `w_tilde_preload` (dimensions
       [image_pixels, 2]). The massive reduction in the size of this matrix in memory allows for much fast computation.

    2) It omits the `mapping_matrix` and instead uses directly the 1D vector that maps every image pixel to a source
       pixel `native_index_for_slim_index`. This exploits the sparsity in the `mapping_matrix` to directly
       compute the `curvature_matrix` (e.g. it condenses the triple matrix multiplication into a double for loop!).

    Parameters
    ----------
    curvature_preload
        A matrix that precomputes the values for fast computation of w_tilde, which in this function is used to bypass

    """
    Returns the curvature matrix `F` (see Warren & Dye 2003) by computing it using `w_tilde_preload`
    (see `w_tilde_preload_interferometer_from`) for an interferometer inversion.

    To compute the curvature matrix via w_tilde the following matrix multiplication is normally performed:

    curvature_matrix = mapping_matrix.T * w_tilde * mapping matrix

    This function speeds this calculation up in two ways:

    1) Instead of using `w_tilde` (dimensions [image_pixels, image_pixels] it uses `w_tilde_preload` (dimensions
       [image_pixels, 2]). The massive reduction in the size of this matrix in memory allows for much fast computation.

    2) It omits the `mapping_matrix` and instead uses directly the 1D vector that maps every image pixel to a source
       pixel `native_index_for_slim_index`. This exploits the sparsity in the `mapping_matrix` to directly
       compute the `curvature_matrix` (e.g. it condenses the triple matrix multiplication into a double for loop!).

    Parameters
    ----------
    curvature_preload
        A matrix that precomputes the values for fast computation of w_tilde, which in this function is used to bypass
        the creation of w_tilde altogether and go directly to the `curvature_matrix`.
    pix_indexes_for_sub_slim_index
        The mappings from a data sub-pixel index to a pixelization's mesh pixel index.
    pix_size_for_sub_slim_index
        The number of mappings between each data sub pixel and pixelization pixel.
    pix_weights_for_sub_slim_index
        The weights of the mappings of every data sub pixel and pixelization pixel.
    native_index_for_slim_index
        An array of shape [total_unmasked_pixels*sub_size] that maps every unmasked sub-pixel to its corresponding
        native 2D pixel using its (y,x) pixel indexes.
    pix_pixels
        The total number of pixels in the pixelization's mesh that reconstructs the data.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The curvature matrix `F` (see Warren & Dye 2003).
