"""Motions to control a robot.

This module defines the motions to control a robot as pydantic models.

Motions:
    JointControl: A joint value, typically an angle.
    FullJointControl: A lsit of joint values.
    HandControl: A 7D space representing x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw, and openness of the hand.
    HeadControl: Tilt and pan.
    MobileSingleArmControl: Control for a robot that can move in planar space with a single arm.
    BimanualArmControl: Control for a robot that can move planar space with two arms.
    HumanoidControl: Control for a robot with two arms, two legs, and a head.

Example:
    To create a new Pydantic model for a motion, inherit from the Motion class and define pydantic fields with the MotionField,
    function as you would with any other Pydantic field.

Example:
    from embdata.motion import Motion, AbsoluteMotionField, MotionField, MotionType, VelocityMotionField
    from embdata.coordinate import PlanarPose, Pose

    class HandControl(Motion):
        pose: Pose = RelativeMotionField(default_factory=Pose, description="Pose of the robot hand.", motion_type="relative")
        grasp: float = AbsoluteMotionField(
            default=0,
            bounds=[-1,1],
            description="Openness of the robot hand. -1 is closed, 1 is open.",
            )

    You can also use the RelativeMotionField and VelocityMotionField or TorqueMotionField for different types of motions.
