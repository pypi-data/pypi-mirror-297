- The **`Episode`** class provides a list-like interface for a sequence of observations, actions, and/or other data. It's designed to streamline exploratory data analysis and manipulation of time series data.
- The `trajectory` method extracts a trajectory from the episode for a specified field, and enables easy visualization and analysis of the data, resampling with different frequencies, and filtering operations, and rescaling/normalizing the data.
- The `show` method visualizes the episode with rerun.io, a platform for visualizing 3D geometrical data, images, and graphs.

- The  **`Sample`** class is a dict-like interface for serializing, recording, and manipulating arbitrary data. It provides methods for flattening and unflattening nested structures, converting between different formats, and integrating with machine learning frameworks and gym spaces.

## Design Decisions

- [x] Grasp value is [-1, 1] so that the default value is 0.
- [x] Motion rather than Action to distinguish from non-physical actions.
- [x] Flattened structures omit full paths to enable dataset transfer between different structures.

#**Key Features**
- Base class for motion-specific data models
- Integration with MotionField and its variants for proper validation and type checking
- Support for defining bounds and motion types

#**Usage Example**

```python
from embdata.motion import Motion
from embdata.motion.fields import VelocityMotionField

class Twist(Motion):
    x: float = VelocityMotionField(default=0.0, bounds=[-1.0, 1.0])
    y: float = VelocityMotionField(default=0.0, bounds=[-1.0, 1.0])
    z: float = VelocityMotionField(default=0.0, bounds=[-1.0, 1.0])
    roll: float = VelocityMotionField(default=0.0, bounds=["-pi", "pi"])
    pitch: float = VelocityMotionField(default=0.0, bounds=["-pi", "pi"])
    yaw: float = VelocityMotionField(default=0.0, bounds=["-pi", "pi"])

# Create a Twist motion
twist = Twist(x=0.5, y=-0.3, z=0.1, roll=0.2, pitch=-0.1, yaw=0.8)

print(twist)  # Output: Twist(x=0.5, y=-0.3, z=0.1, roll=0.2, pitch=-0.1, yaw=0.8)

# Access individual fields
print(twist.x)  # Output: 0.5

# Validate bounds
try:
    invalid_twist = Twist(x=1.5)  # This will raise a ValueError
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Validation error: {e}")

# Example with complex nested structure
class RobotMotion(Motion):
    twist: Twist
    gripper: float = VelocityMotionField(default=0.0, bounds=[0.0, 1.0])

robot_motion = RobotMotion(
    twist=Twist(x=0.2, y=0.1, z=0.0, roll=0.0, pitch=0.0, yaw=0.1),
    gripper=0.5
)
print(robot_motion)
# Output: RobotMotion(twist=Twist(x=0.2, y=0.1, z=0.0, roll=0.0, pitch=0.0, yaw=0.1), gripper=0.5)
```

#**Methods**
- `validate_shape()`: Validates the shape of the motion data

#**Fields**
- `MotionField`: Creates a field for a motion with specified properties
- `AbsoluteMotionField`: Field for an absolute motion
- `RelativeMotionField`: Field for a relative motion
- `VelocityMotionField`: Field for a velocity motion
- `TorqueMotionField`: Field for a torque motion
- `AnyMotionField`: Field for any other type of motion

#### Key Concepts
- Subclasses of Motion should define their fields using MotionField or its variants (e.g., AbsoluteMotionField, VelocityMotionField) to ensure proper validation and type checking.
- The Motion class does not allow extra fields and enforces validation of motion type, shape, and bounds.
- It can handle various types of motion data, including nested structures with images and text, as long as they are properly defined using the appropriate MotionFields.

The `Motion` class provides a flexible foundation for creating motion-specific data models with built-in validation and type checking, making it easier to work with complex motion data in robotics and other applications.

## Data Manipulation Definitions

- [ ] **Flattening**: Flattening is the process of converting a nested data structure into a one-dimensional array or dictionary.
  -  A dimension is with respect to a data structure of interest. For example 1D can be a list of dictionaries where that
    dictionary structure represents a single dimension.
- [ ] **Nesting**: Loosely defined as "structures not in the same list". 
  
    A nesting divides substructures by a boundary defined as "not sharing a list for an ancestor". For example, in a
    list of dictionaries, each dictionary is a separate nesting. All substructures within a dictionary are part of the same nesting so long
    as they are not part of different nestings in a list.

## RL Definitions
<details><summary> Definitions Used by this Library </summary>

- [ ] **Transition**: A transition is a tuple (s, a, r, s') where s is the current state, a is the action taken, r is the reward received, and s' is the next state.
- [ ] **Episode**: An episode is a sequence of transitions that starts at the initial state and ends at a terminal state.
- [ ] **Trajectory**: A trajectory is a sequence of states, actions, and rewards that represents the behavior of an agent over time.
- [ ] **Policy**: A policy is a mapping from states to actions that defines the behavior of an agent.
- [ ] **Value Function**: A value function estimates the expected return from a given state or state-action pair under a given policy.
- [ ] **Q-Function**: A Q-function estimates the expected return from a given state-action pair under a given policy.
- [ ] **Reward Function**: A reward function defines the reward received by an agent for taking a particular action in a particular state.
- [ ] **Model**: A model predicts the next state and reward given the current state and action.
- [ ] **Environment**: An environment is the external system with which an agent interacts, providing states, actions, and rewards.
- [ ] **Agent**: An agent is an entity that interacts with an environment to achieve a goal, typically by learning a policy or value function.
- [ ] **State**: A state is a representation of the environment at a given point in time, typically including observations, measurements, or other data.
- [ ] **Exploration**: Exploration is the process of selecting actions to gather information about the environment and improve the agent's policy or value function.
