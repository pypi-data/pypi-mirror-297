class Mesh(object):
    r"""
    Regular cuboid mesh for nodal finite-differences. If number of cells in
    all principal directions are provided, a 3D mesh is created with
    :math:`(n_1 + 1) \times (n_2 + 1) \times (n_3 + 1)` cells.
    If only :math:`n_1` and :math:`n_2` is provided, a 2D mesh is created
    with a single layer of nodes, but finite thickness.
    If only :math:`n_1` is provided, a 1D mesh is created with a single line
    of nodes, but finite thickness and width.

    :param n: Number of cells in principal directions
    :type n: tuple
    :param dx: Cell-size in principal directions in m
    :type dx: tuple
    :param origin: Coordinate of the bottom-left corner of the mesh
    :type origin: tuple
