# Camoufox Python Interface

#### Lightweight wrapper around the Playwright API to help launch Camoufox.

> [!WARNING]
> This is still experimental and in active development!

## Installation

First, install the `camoufox` package:

```bash
pip install -U camoufox
```

Then, download the Camoufox browser:

**Windows**

```bash
camoufox fetch
```

**MacOS & Linux**

```bash
python3 -m camoufox fetch
```

To uninstall, run `camoufox remove`.

## Usage

Camoufox is fully compatible with your existing Playwright code. You only have to change your browser initialization:

#### Sync API

```python
from camoufox.sync_api import Camoufox

with Camoufox(headless=False) as browser:
    page = browser.new_page()
    page.goto("https://example.com/")
```

#### Async API

```python
from camoufox.async_api import AsyncCamoufox

async with AsyncCamoufox(headless=False) as browser:
    page = await browser.new_page()
    await page.goto("https://example.com")
```

### Config

Camoufox [config data](https://github.com/daijro/camoufox?tab=readme-ov-file#fingerprint-injection) can be passed as a dictionary to the `config` parameter:

```python
from camoufox import Camoufox

with Camoufox(
    config={
        'webrtc:ipv4': '123.45.67.89',
        'webrtc:ipv6': 'e791:d37a:88f6:48d1:2cad:2667:4582:1d6d',
    }
) as browser:
    page = browser.new_page()
    page.goto("https://www.browserscan.net/webrtc")
```

<hr width=50>

### BrowserForge Integration

Camoufox is fully compatible with BrowserForge.

By default, Camoufox will use a random fingerprint. You can also inject your own Firefox Browserforge fingerprint into Camoufox with the following example:

```python
from camoufox.sync_api import Camoufox
from browserforge.fingerprints import FingerprintGenerator

fg = FingerprintGenerator(browser='firefox')

# Launch Camoufox with a random Firefox fingerprint
with Camoufox(fingerprint=fg.generate()) as browser:
    page = browser.new_page()
    page.goto("https://example.com/")
```

<hr width=50>

**Note:** As of now, some properties from BrowserForge fingerprints will not be passed to Camoufox. This is due to the outdated fingerprint dataset from Apify's fingerprint-suite (see [here](https://github.com/apify/fingerprint-suite/discussions/308)). Properties will be re-enabled as soon as an updated dataset is available.
