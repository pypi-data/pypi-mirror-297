    title: Calculate process rarity statistics for logon sessions

    text:
      This first transforms the input data into features suitable
      for a clustering algorithm.

      It then clusters the data based on process, command line and account
      and calculates the rarity of the process pattern.

      It returns a result containing a summary of the logon sessions
      along with full results of the clustering. Methods available to view
      this data graphically include
      - list_sessions_by_rarity - table of sessions ordered by degree of rarity
      - plot_sessions_by_rarity - timeline plot of processes grouped by
        account and showing relative rarity of each process.
      - process_tree - a process tree of all processes or processes belonging
        to a single account.
