    title: Timeline of network flows by protocol type.
  plot_flows_by_direction:
    title: Timeline of network flows by direction.
    text: I = inbound, O = outbound.
  plot_flow_values:
    title: Timeline of network flows quantity.
    text:
      Each protocol is plotted as a separate colored series.
      The vertical axis indicates the number for flows recorded for

    title: Flow Index.
    text:
      List of flows grouped by source, dest, protocol and direction.
  get_flow_summary:
    title: Flow Summary with ASN details.
    text:
      Gets the ASN details from WhoIs.

      The data shows flows grouped by source and destination ASNs.
      All protocol types and all source IP addresses are grouped into

  select_asn_subset:
    title: Select the ASNs to process.
    text:
      Choose any unusual looking ASNs that you want to examine.

      The remote IPs from each selected ASN will be sent to your selected
      Threat Intelligence providers to check if there are indications of
      malicious activity associated with these IPs.

      By default, the most infrequently accessed ASNs are selected.

  lookup_ip_ti:
    title: TI Lookup for IP Addresses in selected ASNs.
    text:
      The remote IPs from each selected ASN are are searched for
      your selected Threat Intelligence providers. Check the
      results to see if there are indications of
      malicious activity associated with these IPs.
