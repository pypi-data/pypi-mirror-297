## Installation

### From PyPI

First create a new virtual environment and activate it or activate desired virtual environment.

Now install the `optimization-problem-inspector` from PyPI with 

```
pip install optimization-problem-inspector
```


### From source

You can also install the package from source. The project is hosted at:

- https://repo.ijs.si/DIS-CI/optimization-problem-inspector

Download the repo and cd to it. Create a fresh virtual environment with python 3.9 or higher, e.g.,

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate it with something like

```bash
# in Linux/Unix
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Now install the package with (use `-e` flag to make and editable install if desired)

```
pip install -e .
```

This will make the package available in the currently activated virtual environment.

#### Using `hatch`

You can also use [hatch](https://github.com/pypa/hatch) to manage dependencies and get some additional extra functionality. After cd-ing to the project directory, you can run

```bash
hatch run python

```

to start Python3 shell with `optimization-problem-inspector installed`.

## Running GUI

To run the `optimization-problem-inspector` GUI after installation process has completed, type command

```bash
opi-gui
```

You can also run the GUI with

```bash
python -m optimization_problem_inspector.app
```

> Note: the desired virtual environment with `optimization-problem-inspector` has to be activated.

> Note: use `python` or `python3` command, depending on what executables you have available for Python3.
