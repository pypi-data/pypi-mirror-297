           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a

              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# QSS: Quadratic-Separable Solver
QSS solves problems of the form 

$$\begin{equation*} \begin{array}{ll} \text{minimize} & (1/2) x^T P x + q^T x + r + g(x) \\\\ \text{subject to} & Ax = b \end{array} \end{equation*}$$

where $x \in \bf{R}^n$ is the decision variable being optimized over. The
objective is defined by a positive definite matrix $P \in \bf{S}^n_+$, a vector
$q \in \bf{R}^n$, a scalar $r \in \bf{R}$, and a $g$ that is separable in the
entries of $x$, i.e., $g$ can be written as 
$$g(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n g_i(x_i).$$
The constraints are defined by a matrix $A \in \bf{R}^{m \times n}$ and a vector
$b \in \bf{R}^m$. 

To use QSS, the user must specify $P$, $q$, $r$, $A$, $b$, as well as the $g_i$ from a built-in collection of separable functions. 

## Installation
```
pip install qss
```

## Usage
After installing `qss`, import it with
```python
import qss
```
This will expose the QSS class which is used to instantiate a solver object:
```python
solver = qss.QSS(data)
```
Use the `solve()` method when ready to solve:
```python
results = solver.solve(eps_abs=1e-5,
                       eps_rel=1e-5,
                       alpha=1.4,
                       rho=0.1,
                       max_iter=np.inf,
                       precond=True,
                       warm_start=False,
                       reg=True,
                       use_iter_refinement=False,
                       verbose=False,
                       )
```

### Parameters
- `data`: dictionary with the following keys:
    - `'P'`, `'q'`, `'r'`, `'A'`, `'b'` specify the quadratic part of the objective and the linear constraint as in the problem formulation above. `'P'` and `'A'` should be `scipy.sparse` CSC matrices or QSS `LinearOperator`s (see below), `'q'` and `'b'` should be `numpy` arrays,  and `'r'` should be a scalar. `'A'` and `'b'` can be excluded from `data` or set to `None` if the linear equality constraints are not needed. 
    - `'g'` is a list of separable function definitions. Each separable function is declared as a dictionary with the following keys:
        - `'g'`: string that corresponds to a valid separable function name (see below for a list of supported functions).
        - `'args'`: `'weight'` (default 1), `'scale'` (default 1), `'shift'` (default 0) allow the `'g'` function to be applied in a weighted manner to a shifted and scaled input. Some functions take additional arguments, see below. 
        - `'range'`: tuple specifying the start index and end index that the function should be applied to.
    
        Note that the zero function will be applied to any indices that don't have another function specified for them.
- `eps_abs`: scalar specifying absolute tolerance.
- `eps_abs`: scalar specifying relative tolerance.
- `alpha`: scalar specifying overstep size.
- `rho`: scalar specifying ADMM step size.
- `max_iter`: maximum number of ADMM iterations to perform.
- `precond`: boolean specifying whether to perform matrix equilibration.
- `warm_start`: boolean specifying whether to warm start upon a repeat call of
  `solve()`.
- `reg`: boolean specifying whether to regularize KKT matrix. May fail on certain problem instances if set to `False`.
- `use_iter_refinement`: boolean, only matters if `reg` is `True`. Helps mitigate some of the accuracy loss due to regularization. 
- `verbose`: boolean specifying whether to print verbose output.

### Returns
A list containing the following:
- `objective`: the objective value attained by the solution found by `qss`. 
- `solution`: the solution vector.

### Separable functions
The following convex separable functions are supported ( $\mathcal{I}$ is the $\\{0, \infty\\}$ indicator function):
Function | Parameters | $g_i(x)$
--- | --- | ---
`zero` | | $0$
`abs` | | $\|x\|$
`is_pos` | | $\mathcal I(x \geq 0)$
`is_neg` | | $\mathcal I(x \leq 0)$
`is_bound` | `lb`: lower bound (default 0), `ub`: upper bound (default 1) | $\mathcal I(l \leq x \leq u)$
`is_zero` | | $\mathcal I(x = 0)$
`pos` | | $\max\\{x, 0\\}$
`neg` | | $\max\\{-x, 0\\}$
`quantile` | `tau`: scalar in $(0, 1)$ | $0.5 \|x\| + (\tau - 0.5) x$
`huber` | `M`: positive scalar | $x^2 \text{ if } \|x\| \leq M, 2M\|x\| - M^2 \text{ else}$

The following nonconvex separable functions are supported:
Function | Parameters | $g_i(x)$
--- | --- | ---
`card` | | $0$ for $x = 0$; $1$ for $x \neq 0$
`is_int` | | $\mathcal I(x \text{ is an integer})$
`is_finite_set` | `S`: Python list of scalars | $\mathcal I(x \in S)$
`is_bool` | | $\mathcal I(x \in \\{0,1\\})$

The `t` (weight), `a` (scale), `b` (shift) parameters are used to shift and scale the above as follows: `t * g(ax - b)`.

#### Example
Applying the Huber function to a shifted version of the first 100 entries:
```python
[{"g": "huber", "args": {"M": 2, "shift": -5}, "range": (0, 100)}]
```

### Abstract linear operators
QSS comes with built-in support for abstract linear operators via the `qss.linearoperator.LinearOperator` class (hereafter referred to simply as `LinearOperator`).

The easiest way to build a `LinearOperator` is via its constructor. The argument to the constructor should be a list of lists representing a block matrix, in which each block is one of the following:
- SciPy sparse matrix or
- [`scipy.sparse.linalg.LinearOperator`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.linalg.LinearOperator.html) or
- `qss.linearoperator.LinearOperator` or
- `None`.

As an example, a constraint matrix `A` could be built as follows:
```python
from qss.linearoperator import LinearOperator

A = LinearOperator([
    [None, F, -I],
    [I, I, None]
])
```
Where `F` is a `scipy.sparse.linalg.LinearOperator` that implements the Fourier transform and `I` is a SciPy sparse identity matrix. 

There are several helper functions available to facilitate the creation of `LinearOperator`s, all accessible through `qss.linearoperator`: 
- `block_diag(D)`: Returns a block diagonal `LinearOperator` from `D`, a list of linear operators (SciPy sparse matrix, `scipy.sparse.linalg.LinearOperator`, or `qss.linearoperator.LinearOperator`).
- `hstack(D)`: Horizontally concatenates list of linear operators `D` into a single `LinearOperator`.
- `vstack(D)`: Vertically concatenates a list of linear operators `D` into a single `LinearOperator`.

Left and right matrix multiplication between a `LinearOperator` and a NumPy array is supported. Multiplication between `LinearOperator`s is currently not supported. Matrix-vector multiplication between a `LinearOperator` `F` and a NumPy array `v` can be achieved with `F.matvec(v)` or `F @ v`. Multiplication with the adjoint of `F` can be achieved with `F.rmatvec(v)` or `v @ F`. 

Note that solve times may be slower when `LinearOperator`s are involved. If either `P` or `A` is a `LinearOperator`, the linear KKT system central to the QSS algorithm is solved indirectly, as opposed to directly via a factorization. 


### Example
Nonnegative least squares is a problem of the form

$$\begin{equation*} \begin{array}{ll} \text{minimize} & (1/2) \Vert Gx - h \Vert_2^2 \\\\ \text{subject to} & x \geq 0. \end{array} \end{equation*} $$

`qss` can be used to solve this problem as follows:
```python
import numpy as np
import scipy as sp
import qss

p = 100
n = 500
G = sp.sparse.random(n, p, density=0.2, format="csc")
h = np.random.rand(n)

data = {}
data["P"] = G.T @ G
data["q"] = -h.T @ G
data["r"] = 0.5 * h.T @ h
data["g"] = [{"g": "is_pos", "range": (0, p)}] # Enforce x >= 0

solver = qss.QSS(data)
objective, x = solver.solve()
print(objective)
```

## Development
To create a virtual environment, run
```
python3 -m venv env
```
Activate it with 
```
source env/bin/activate
```
Clone the `qss` repository, `cd` into it, and install `qss` in development mode:
```
pip install -e ./ -r requirements.txt
```
Finally, test to make sure the installation worked:
```
pytest tests/
```
