        """Create a named query.

        Named queries are aliases for specific queries that can be used by API clients.

        Parameters
        ----------
        name
            A name for the named queryâ€”this can be versioned with the version parameter, but
            must otherwise be unique. The name of the named query shows up in the dashboard and
            is used to specify the outputs for a query.
        version
            A string specifying the version of the named query.
        input
            The features which will be provided by callers of this query.
            For example, `[User.id]`. Features can also be expressed as snakecased strings,
            e.g. `["user.id"]`.
        output
            Outputs are the features that you'd like to compute from the inputs.
            For example, `[User.age, User.name, User.email]`.

            If an empty sequence, the output will be set to all features on the namespace
            of the query. For example, if you pass as input `{"user.id": 1234}`, then the query
            is defined on the `User` namespace, and all features on the `User` namespace
            (excluding has-one and has-many relationships) will be used as outputs.
        tags
            Allows selecting resolvers with these tags.
        description
            A description of the query. Rendered in the Chalk UI and used for search indexing.
        owner
            The owner of the query. This should be a Slack username or email address.
            This is used to notify the owner in case of incidents
        meta
            Additional metadata for the query.
        staleness
            Maximum staleness overrides for any output features or intermediate features.
            See https://docs.chalk.ai/docs/query-caching for more information.
        planner_options
            Dictionary of additional options to pass to the Chalk query engine.
            Values may be provided as part of conversations with Chalk support
            to enable or disable specific functionality.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> from chalk import NamedQuery
        >>> # this query's name and version can be used to specify query outputs in an API request.

        ...     name="fraud_model",
