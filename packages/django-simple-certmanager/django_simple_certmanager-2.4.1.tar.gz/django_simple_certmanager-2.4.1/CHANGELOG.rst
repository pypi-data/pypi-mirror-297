2.4.0
=====

*September 19, 2024*

Feature release: certificate signing requests.

* [#41, #44, #45, #47] You can now create certificate signing requests from the admin
  interface, instead of needing to run OpenSSL somewhere and then copy/upload all the
  relevant files.
* Fixed test failures in projects when using the ``CertificateFactory`` - the bundled
  private key/public certificate have been regenerated as they had expired.

2.3.0
=====

*July 19, 2024*

Small feature release

* The ``Certificate`` model now publicly exposes the ``certificate`` attribute, which
  returns the certificate loaded through ``cryptography``.

=====

*July 18, 2024*

Feature release: encrypted private keys

Note: 2.1.0 was accidentally published to PyPI and has been yanked.

  to be provided and are stored in unencrypted form.
* Added a pytest plugin to expose certificate/key generation fixtures for downstream
  packages.
