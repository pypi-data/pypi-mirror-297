# UQ[py]Lab
UQ[py]Lab is the official python client of the UQCloud project, which aims at providing a cloud-based, language agnostic API to the [UQLab](https://uqlab.com) uncertainty quantification framework.

After registration, you will find all the information you need to connect to the UQCloud servers at your personal profile page on [https://uqpylab.uq-cloud.io](https://uqpylab.uq-cloud.io).
