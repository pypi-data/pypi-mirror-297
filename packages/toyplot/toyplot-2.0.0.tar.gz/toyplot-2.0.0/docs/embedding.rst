Embedding
=========

We like to say that "Toyplot figures are beautiful, scalable,
embeddable, and interactive", but what does *embeddable* really mean,
anyway? Scientists and engineers are already accustomed to embedding
static images in their publications and presentations, so what does
embedding in Toyplot have to offer that other tools don't?

In a word: interaction.

In their preferred HTML format, Toyplot figures are
interactive - users can mouse over the figure to see interactive
coordinates and even extract the data from a figure in CSV format using
a context menu. This is just scratching the surface of what we want to
achieve in interactivity, but the key point is that each figure is
*completely self contained* and can be distributed as a single file
without any need for a server, libraries, stylesheets, or even a network
connection.

Here are some examples of Toyplot embedding in-action:

Jupyter (IPython) Notebooks
---------------------------

To use Toyplot in a Jupyter (IPython) notebook, simply import the
library and create a plot - no extra statements, "magics", or backend configuration required. The library
knows that it's being executed in the Jupyter environment, and
automatically renders the plot into your notebook using the interactive
HTML format:

.. image:: jupyter-embedding.png

"This is all well and good", you may say, "and the interaction is nice,
but it's hardly a game-changer".

But wait! This is where the self-contained nature of Toyplot figures really
starts to shine.  For example, if you use the notebook's `File > Download as >
HTML (.html)` menu command, your browser will download an HTML copy of the
notebook, with the Toyplot figures embedded, as you might expect.  What you
might `not` expect is that the figures will still be live and interactive!

Slides
------

As another example, you can convert your Jupyter notebook into an interactive
`Reveal.js <http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#>`_ presentation using the nbconvert
utility, and the embedded Toyplot figures in your slides will still be
interactive during your presentation:

``ipython nbconvert mynotebook.ipynb --to slides --post serve``

Imagine being able to respond to audience questions with a live figure that was
authored in a completely separate environment!

Documentation
-------------

Similarly, you can convert a Jupyter notebook to restructured text (the markup of
choice for most Python documentation):

::

    $ ipython nbconvert mynotebook.ipynb --to rst --output mynotebook.rst

and the HTML Toyplot figures will be embedded in the restructured text and remain
fully-interactive in the generated docs. This, by the way, is how much of the
Toyplot documentation you're reading right now is written - we
author examples using Jupyter notebooks, which are converted to .rst files,
then compiled into HTML documentation using `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org>`_:

Electronic Publication
----------------------

This leads to one of our key goals for Toyplot: supporting electronic
publication, and changing what people expect from data graphics.  Many
scientific and engineering journals have begun to experiment with HTML-based
publishing formats, and figures created with Toyplot are uniquely suited to the
HTML publishing environment, providing useful interaction in a completely
self-contained "package" that can be trivially inserted into an HTML document
without introducing any other dependencies.  Because Toyplot figures don't rely
on external servers, libraries or stylesheets, they can be embedded, copied,
and moved from place-to-place where they will continue to Just Work without
modification - properties that are critical for archival and accessibility.

E-Mail
------

Because a Toyplot figure is fully self-contained, it can be easily shared
through e-mail or other electronic communication channels. You can e-mail a
Toyplot figure to a colleague as an HTML file, and they will be able to easily
view and interact with the file, in many cases right inside their e-mail
client!

PyQT / PySide
-------------

Because the Qt graphical user interface includes a fully-featured WebKit
browser and Python bindings (PyQt or PySide, take your pick), you can
embed interactive Toyplot plots in just a few lines of code, with all
the interaction intact:

.. code:: python

    window = QWebView()
    canvas, axes, mark = toyplot.plot(x, y)
    window.setHtml(xml.etree.ElementTree.tostring(toyplot.html.render(canvas), method="html"))

If you prefer, you could also embed static plots using the SVG or PNG
backends:

.. code:: python

    window.setContent(xml.tostring(toyplot.svg.render(canvas)), "image/svg+xml")

or

.. code:: python

    window.setContent(toyplot.png.render(canvas), "image/png")

Programmatic Embedding
----------------------

Toyplot provides a wide variety of :ref:`rendering` backends in addition to the
preferred, interactive HTML backend.  The API implemented by the backends has
been carefully crafted to support embedding and maximize consistency:

* Most backends take a `fileobj` parameter in their `render` method.  If you pass a string `fileobj`, the canvas will be written to the given filename on disk.
* If you pass a file-like object as the `fileobj` parameter, the canvas will be written directly to the object.  So you could store any figure to an in-memory :class:`io.StringIO` buffer for subsequent processing, for example.
* If you don't supply the `fileobj` parameter when rendering, the canvas will be returned to the caller in whatever high-level form is most appropriate for that backend:
    * The :mod:`toyplot.html` and :mod:`toyplot.svg` backends return an instance of :class:`xml.etree.ElementTree.Element` that contains the DOM representation of the figure.  This makes it easy to manipulate the figure for embedding in a larger DOM or subsequent processing.
    * The :mod:`toyplot.pdf` and :mod:`toyplot.png` backends return the raw bytes of a PDF or PNG file, respectively.  So you could pass the PNG image to :func:`PIL.Image.open`, for example.
