class InstanceStore:
    """

    An instance store, which can be used to manage the process of instance
    creation for instances of flyweight classes.
    Instances are stored internally in a :class:`~weakref.WeakValueDictionary`,
    indexed by their class and a user-provided instance key.

    The :meth:`instance` method implements a context manager for use within the
    flyweight class constructor, within which managed instance creation can be
    performed.

    The :meth:`register` method must be called within the :meth:`instance`
    context when a new instance is created, as opposed to when an existing
    instance is used.

    .. code-block:: python

        class MyClass:

            __store: ClassVar[InstanceStore] = InstanceStore()

            def __new__(cls, ...) -> Self:
                #       args ^^^
                key = ...# derive instance key from constructor args
                with MyClass.__store.instance(cls, key) as self:
                    if self is None: # if no instance with given key exists
                        self = super().__new__(cls)
                        ... # <- set instance attributes here
                        MyClass.__store.register(self)
                    return self

            ... # <- class body here

    In order to customise the instance creation process, it will typically be
    necessary to implement flyweight class constructors using
    `__new__ <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__new__>`_,
    rather than
    `__init__ <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__init__>`_.

    If `pickle <https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html>` support is
    desirable, flyweight classes should implement either the
    `__getnewargs__ <https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#object.__getnewargs__>`_
    method or the
    `__getnewargs_ex__ <https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#object.__getnewargs_ex__>`_
    method, depending on whether the constructor takes keyword-only arguments.
    Classes should also implement
    `__getstate__` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#object.__getstate__>`_
    to return :obj:`None`, in order to prevent the default
    `__setstate__` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#object.__setstate__>`_
    being called by the pickling process (cf.
    `PEP 307 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0307/#case-3-pickling-new-style-class-instances-using-protocol-2>`_).

        """
        Context manager to manage the creation of an instance of the given
        class, uniquely identified by the given key.

        If an instance with the given key already exists, it is yielded.
        Otherwise, the following procedure is followed:

        1. The instance building process is started.
        2. The value :obj:`None` is yielded, to signal to the context
           that no instance with the given key exists yet.
        3. Once control is returned to the context manager, it checks
           that an instance was registered using the :meth`register` method,
           and that it is actually an instance of the given class.
        4. If the checks from Step 3 are successful, the instance is stored
           using the given class and key.
        5. Regardless of whether the checks from Step 3 are successful, the
           instance building process is terminated.

        It is possible for the same instance building process to be shared
        by multiple contexts, e.g. when using the same store for instances
        of a class and its subclasses.
        If the context manager is invoked multiple times, it yields the
        same value across all calls, but the instance process is started
        at most once by the outermost call, and fully handled by it.
        This makes it possible to create subclasses of a flyweight class.

        If the instance building process is started, the
        :meth:`~InstanceStore.register` method must be called exactly once.

        Failure to comply with the above requirements results in an
        :exc:`AssertionError` being raised.
        For the sake of performance, all validation is done by assertions,
        so it is removed when compiling with the
        `-O flag <https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-O>`_.
