## Introduction
This Python module provides a set of functions to streamline feature engineering, target generation, rolling window model training, and model evaluation for time-series data. It is particularly designed for financial data like stock prices, allowing the user to create momentum-based features, moving averages, seasonality features, and more. This tool also provides feature selection utilities and model evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Installation

Before running the code, make sure the following libraries are installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas ta-lib scikit-learn statsmodels matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage/Examples

### Code Example: Feature Engineering

The function prepare_features generates technical indicators based on stock price data, including momentum, moving averages, Bollinger Bands, and more.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from ta.momentum import RSIIndicator
from ta.volatility import BollingerBands

# Sample input dataframe
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Close': [100, 102, 101, 105, 107, 109, 108, 110, 111, 113],
    'Volume': [2000, 2100, 2050, 2200, 2300, 2250, 2400, 2500, 2450, 2600]
}, index=pd.date_range('2023-01-01', periods=10))

# Call the feature engineering function
feature_names = prepare_features(data)

print(data[feature_names].head())
```

### Code Example: Target Computation

```python
# Generate target for the given dataframe
target = compute_target(data, SL=1, TP=3, future_periods=3)

print(target)
```

### Full Example with Model Training

```python
# Feature engineering on full dataset
x_train, y_train = feature_engineering(data, 'train', future_periods=3)

# Train a random forest model
rf_model = RandomForestClassifier()
rf_model.fit(x_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = rf_model.predict(x_train)

# Evaluate the model
evaluation = model_evaluation(
    labels=y_train,
    predictions=y_pred,
    model=rf_model,
    x=x_train,
    y=y_train
)

print(evaluation)
```
