PyFinitDiff
===========

PyFinitDiff is a robust Python package designed to compute finite-difference matrices with an intuitive API. This package provides an efficient and user-friendly interface for generating finite-difference approximations, making it ideal for numerical analysis and scientific computing.


Features
********
- **Intuitive API**: PyFinitDiff offers an easy-to-use interface that allows users to generate finite-difference matrices with minimal effort.
- **Versatile Applications**: Suitable for a wide range of numerical methods including solving partial differential equations (PDEs), performing numerical differentiation, and more.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed documentation and examples to help users get started quickly.

Installation
------------

PyFinitDiff requires Python 3.10+ and is available on PyPi for various operating systems including Linux and macOS.

Install PyFinitDiff via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install PyFinitDiff

Documentation
*************
Comprehensive and up-to-date documentation is available online. You can access it `here <https://pyfinitdiff.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ or by clicking the badge below:

Usage Example
*************

Below is a simple example to illustrate how to use PyFinitDiff:

.. code-block:: python

   from PyFinitDiff.finite_difference_1D import FiniteDifference
   from PyFinitDiff.finite_difference_1D import Boundaries

   boundaries = Boundaries(left='none', right='none')

   n_x = 100
   fd = FiniteDifference(
      n_x=n_x,
      dx=1,
      derivative=2,
      accuracy=2,
      boundaries=boundaries
   )

   fd.triplet.plot()

   dense_matrix = fd.triplet.to_scipy_sparse()

   sparse_matrix = fd.triplet.to_scipy_sparse()

This would produce the following figure:

|example_triplet_0|

This example demonstrates the creation of a second-order finite-difference matrix with a specified grid spacing and size.

Testing
*******

To test PyFinitDiff locally, clone the GitHub repository and run the tests with coverage:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/MartinPdeS/PyFinitDiff.git
   cd PyFinitDiff
   pip install PyFinitDiff[testing]
   pytest
