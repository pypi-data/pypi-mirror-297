RyteBoxFormat allows user to 
select xls or xlsx files, 
select the tab to process, 
enter last working record and header row, 
and to select the income statement file type to inform mapping logic. 

RyteBoxFormat then translates the file provided into the RyteBox Royalty System standard format and creates a new spreadsheet from it.
