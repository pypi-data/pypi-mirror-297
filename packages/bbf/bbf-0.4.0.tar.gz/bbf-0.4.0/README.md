A module to evaluate the broadband fluxes and magnitudes of spectrophotometric
standards.


# Installation

Below are instruction to install the `bbf` package on Linux or MacOS systems. It should work
on Windows too, but is has not been tested.


## In brief

The quick way for end users. If you are a developer or have an issue with the
above instructions, follow the [detailed instructions](#detailed instructions)

We recommand using `conda` (or its faster equivalent `mamba`), which comes with
a compiled version of `suitesparse`. Conda packages for `bbf` are [in
preparation (but not ready
yet)](https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/27367), meanwhile,
follow the instructions below.

Do not forget to activate your `conda` environment (or to create a new one):

```bash
conda create --name <my-env>
conda activate <my-env>
```

On Linux:

```bash
conda install libgomp gcc cmake ipython matplotlib numpy pandas scikit-sparse scipy h5py pyarrow
pip install git+https://github.com/nregnault/sncosmo
pip install bbf
```

On macos:

```bash
conda install openmp clangxx cmake ipython matplotlib numpy pandas scikit-sparse scipy h5py pyarrow
pip install git+https://github.com/nregnault/sncosmo
pip install bbf
```


## Detailed instructions

### Prerequisites

* You need a C++ compiler (usually `gcc` on Linux or `clang` on macos).

* You also need some Python dependencies installable with `conda`

    ```bash
    conda install ipython matplotlib numpy pandas scikit-sparse scipy h5py pyarrow
    ```

* Moreover, `bbf` relies for the moment on a [modified version of
  `sncosmo`](https://github.com/nregnault/sncosmo) for passbands and magsys
  definition. You need to install it before installing `bbf`:

    ```bash
    pip install git+https://github.com/nregnault/sncosmo
    ```


### Installing bbf

```bash
pip install bbf
```

If you prefer installing from sources:

```bash
git clone clone git@gitlab.in2p3.fr:lemaitre/bbf.git
cd bbf
pip install .
```

If your you are a developper and want to work on the `bbf` package:

```bash
pip install nanobind ninja scikit-build-core[pyproject]
pip install --no-build-isolation -Ceditable.rebuild=true -ve .
```


## Installing the Lemaitre bandpasses

If you plan to use the latest version of the megacam6, ztf and hsc passbands,
install the `lemaitre.bandpasses` package:

```bash
pip install lemaitre-bandpasses
```

or

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/lemaitre/lemaitre/bandpasses
cd bandpasses
git lfs pull
pip install .
```

# Getting started

The goal of `bbf` is to efficiently compute broadband fluxes and magnitudes,
i.e. quantities of the form:

$$f_{xys} = \int S(\lambda) \lambda T_{xys}(\lambda) d\lambda$$

where $\lambda$ is the SED of an object, $T_{xyz}(\lambda)$ is the bandpass of
the instrument used to observe it. $T$ may depend on the focal plane position of
the object and, if the focal plane is a mosaic of sensors, on the specific
sensor $s$ where the observation is made. In practice, $x,y$ are coordinates, in
pixels, in the sensor frame, and $s$ is a unique sensor index (or amplifier
index).

Computing magnitudes requires an additional ingredient: the flux of a reference
spectrum $S_{ref}(\lambda)$, usually the AB spectrum, integrated in the same
passband (same sensor, same position).

$$m = -2.5 \log_{10} \left(\frac{\int S(\lambda) \lambda T_{xyz}(\lambda) d\lambda}{\int S_{ref}(\lambda) \lambda T_{xyz}(\lambda) d\lambda}\right)$$

To compute these integrales, `bbf` uses the technique implemented in `nacl`,
which consists in projecting the bandpasses and SED on spline bases:

$$S(\lambda) = \sum_i \theta_i {\cal B}_i(\lambda)$$

and

$$T(\lambda) = \sum_j t_j {\cal B}_j(\lambda)$$

If we precompute the products $G_{ij} = \int \lambda {\cal B}_i(\lambda) {\cal B}_j(\lambda) d\lambda$
the integrals above can be expressed as a simple contraction:

$$f = \theta_i G_{ij} t_j$$

where $G$ is very sparse, since the B-Splines ${\cal B}_i$ have a compact
support. If the bandpass $T$ is spatially variable, the $t_j$ coefficients are
themselves developped on a spatial spline basis.

$$t_j = \sum_{kj} \tau_{kj} {\cal K}(x,y)$$

The contraction above is then of the form: ...

## FilterSets and StellarLibs

`bbf` implements two main kind of objects: `FilterLib`, which holds a set of
band passes, projected on spline bases (${\cal K_j(x,y)}$ and ${\cal
B}_i_(\lambda)$), and `StellarLib` which manages a set of spectra, also
projected on a spline basis (not necessily the splines used for the filters).


## Loading a filter lib

Building a complete version of a `FilterLib` requires some care. The standard
`FilterLib` used in the Lema√Ætre analysis is build and maintained within the
package `lemaitre.bandpasses`. To access it:

``` python
from lemaitre import bandpasses

flib = bandpasses.get_filterlib()
```
The first time this function is called, the `FilterLib`` is built and cached. The subsequent calls
access the cached version, and never take more than a few milliseconds.

## Loading Stellar Libraries

As of today, `bbf` implements two kinds of StellarLibs: pickles and Calspec. An
interface to gaiaXP is in development.

To load the pickles library:

``` python

import bbf.stellarlib.pickles
pickles = bbf.stellarlib.pickles.fetch()
```

To load the most recent version of Calspec:

``` python
import bbf.stellarlib.calspec
calspec = bbf.stellarlib.calspec.fetch()
```


## Computing Broadband fluxes

With a `FilterSet` and a `StellarLib` in hand, one can compute broadband fluxes and broadband mags.

### Broadband fluxes

``` python
import bbf.stellarlib.pickles
from lemaitre import bandpasses

flib = bandpasses.get_filterlib()
pickles = bbf.stellarlib.pickles.fetch()

# number of measurements
nmeas = 100_000

# which stars ?
star = np.random.choice(np.arange(0, len(pickles)), size=nmeas)

# in which band ?
band = np.random.choice(['ztf::g', 'ztf::r', 'ztf::I'], size=nmeas)

# observation positions
x = np.random.uniform(0., 3072., size=nmeas)
y = np.random.uniform(0., 3080., size=nmeas)
sensor_id = np.random.choice(np.arange(1, 65), size=nmeas)

fluxes = flib.flux(pickles, star, band, x=x, y=y, sensor_id=sensor_id)
```


### Broadband magnitudes

To convert broadband fluxes into broadband magnitudes, we need to compute the reference fluxes,
in the same effective measurement band passes. This is done using an auxiliary object called `MagSys`:

``` python

from bbf.magsys import SpecMagSys
import bbf.stellarlib.pickles
from lemaitre import bandpasses

flib = bandpasses.get_filterlib()
pickles = bbf.stellarlib.pickles.fetch()

# number of measurements
nmeas = 100_000

# which stars ?
star = np.random.choice(np.arange(0, len(pickles)), size=nmeas)

# in which band ?
band = np.random.choice(['ztf::g', 'ztf::r', 'ztf::I'], size=nmeas)

# observation positions
x = np.random.uniform(0., 3072., size=nmeas)
y = np.random.uniform(0., 3080., size=nmeas)
sensor_id = np.random.choice(np.arange(1, 65), size=nmeas)

ms = SpecMagSys('AB')
mags = ms.mag(pickles, star, band, x=x, y=y, sensor_id=sensor_id)
```
