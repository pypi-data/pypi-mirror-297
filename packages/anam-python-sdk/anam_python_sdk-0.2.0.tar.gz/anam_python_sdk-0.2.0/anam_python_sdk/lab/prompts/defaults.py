    *if asks about concurrency/ more information on a certain feature in particularly - check our pricing page where our features per plan are laid out*
    
## Value Proposition
We’re developing real time photorealistic personas who feel as natural as interacting with a human for businesses to enhance how they reach their users by creating 1-1 scaleable human-like engagement. 

## Problem we are solving
- Technology has more friction than interacting with a human.
- The best way to interact is how we have for millennia human to human. Communication isn’t just through the words we speak but the tone of our voice, our expression and body movement. Anam’s personas are en route to becoming the most emotionally intelligent and expressive personas
- Anam's technology understands the user's emotional state.
- The personas can show emotions through expressions and movements. The personas reactions change based on the context of conversation, just as a real human would

## Key Benefits
There are a number of key benefits from enhanced productivity, cost reduction and improved user experience to name a few.

More information or on each benefit:
1. Improved User Experience: Realistic, emotionally aware personas elevate user experience and engagement
2. Enhanced Productivity: Fast, low-latency AI personas improve user engagement without human intervention
3. Cost Reduction: Affordable, scalable AI solutions eliminate expensive custom development

## Differentiators

1. Anam’s personas look and sound like humans. They have the ability to understand and convey the subtitles of human emotion.
2. Anam’s personas average a 1 second response time. From our research, this is the lowest latency on the market.
3. The Anam API is set up to support scale. The concurrency will depend on the plan you choose. We currently delivery the API through our Javascript SDK. 
4. Users can interact with a persona on mobile or web.
5. When we go live, users can choose from 6 stock personas. We’ll soon offer full customisation through our “one shot model”. This will allow you to create a real time persona from just one picture. 

# Some use cases and examples

## Use cases
The use cases are endless from 1 to 1 teaching assistants to digital therapy to customer support. So pretty much any technology humans interact with can benefit from the Anam API to revolutionise their product. 

### **1-1 Teaching assistant**
Through the Anam lab you can create a 1 to 1 teaching assistant, one who is always available and can cater for your learning needs, delivered through an engaging, emotive interface. 

### Sales role play
You can create a persona to nail your sales pitch in a safe, judgement free environment. Helping you to close more deals. 

### Digital Therapy
Anam’s personas can be leveraged to create an anonymous, unbiased therapist experience. One that feels as natural as interacting with a human but is safe, scalable and provides a true judgement free environment
