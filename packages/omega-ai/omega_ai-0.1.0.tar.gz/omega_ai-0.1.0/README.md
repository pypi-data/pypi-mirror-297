# Omega: A Library of AI Invented Machine Learning Algorithms

![Omega Logo](omega_logo.png)

Omega is an open-source Python library containing novel machine learning algorithms generated through automated algorithmic synthesis techniques. These algorithms push the boundaries of traditional machine learning approaches and offer unique capabilities for tackling complex data analysis tasks.

## Key Features

- **Novel Algorithms**: Includes machine learning algorithms not found in other libraries, created through evolutionary computation and neural architecture search.
- **Simple Scikit-Learn Style Interface**: Follows scikit-learn API conventions for easy integration into existing ML pipelines.

## Installation

```bash
pip install omega-ml
```

## Quick Start

```python
from omega import HybridKNNClassifier

# Load your dataset
X, y = load_dataset()

# Initialize and train the model
model = HybridKNNClassifier()
model.fit(X, y)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

## Featured Algorithms

- **HybridKNNClassifier**: An advanced k-nearest neighbors algorithm incorporating multi-level abstraction.
- **MultiLevelAbstractionKNN**: KNN variant with enhanced feature space transformation.
- **EntropyGuidedKNN**: KNN algorithm guided by information-theoretic principles.
- **BiasVarianceOptimizedKNNEnsemble**: Ensemble method balancing bias and variance trade-offs.
