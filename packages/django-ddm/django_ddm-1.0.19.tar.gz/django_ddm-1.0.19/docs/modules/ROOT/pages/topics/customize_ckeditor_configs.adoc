DDM uses https://pypi.org/project/django-ckeditor/[Django CKEditor] for some of
its forms.

A custom configuration of the CKEditor for ddm is implemented in the app itself.
However, you can overwrite the default configuration by adding a `CKEDITOR_CONFIGS`
setting to your projects settings.py that includes a setting named
`'ddm_ckeditor'` that defines the CKEditor appearance for DDM:

[source, python]
----
# settings.py

CKEDITOR_CONFIGS = {
    'ddm_ckeditor': {
        'toolbar': 'Basic',
        # etc.
    },
}
----

For an overview of configuration options consult the
https://github.com/django-ckeditor/django-ckeditor#example-ckeditor-configuration [Django CKEditor Repository].
