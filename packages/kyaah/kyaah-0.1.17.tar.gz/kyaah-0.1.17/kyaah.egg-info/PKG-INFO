# Installation & Usage

First, you are recommended to create a virtual environment `python -m venv venv` and then activate it `source venv/bin/activate`, next install the library using:

```sh
    pip install kyaah
```

Wait for the installation to finish, basically the library was uploaded using `sdist` (Source Distribution) and `bdist_wheel` (Built Distribution).

After that, simply import the library and set payload, which include `sender`, `receiver`, `subject`, `body`, and `password` and lastly call the `send` method and pass the `payload` as a keyword just like the sample below:

```python
    import kyaah
        
    payload = dict(
        sender = "sender@gmail.com",
        receiver = ["receiver@gmail.com"],
        subject = "Hellow world!",
        body = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet adipisicing elit, rerum voluptate ipsum volupt.",
        password = "*********",
    )

    kyaah.send(credentials=payload)
```

> **Note**
> The password to use, is app password, take note that if you use your traditional mail password that you use to login, it won't give access to!
