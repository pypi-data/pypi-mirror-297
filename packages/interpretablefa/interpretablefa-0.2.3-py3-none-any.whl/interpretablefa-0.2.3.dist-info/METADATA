# The interpretablefa package
This is a package for performing interpretable factor analysis. This implements the priorimax and interpmax rotations and procedures, which are described [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11525).

It also contains several helper and visualization functions and wraps several functions from the `factor_analyzer` package.

The linked paper provides some documentation to the package and docstrings are available. However, a comprehensive guide or documentation is still under development.
