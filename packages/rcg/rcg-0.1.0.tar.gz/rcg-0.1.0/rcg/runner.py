"""
This script provides a command-line interface for creating and adding multiple subcatchments
to an existing SWMM model. The user will be prompted to provide input for each subcatchment's
area, land use type, and land form type. The subcatchments will be added to the model
and the updated model will be saved.

Usage:
    python3 runner.py file_path

Example:
    python3 runner.py example.inp

Arguments:
    file_path: The path to the SWMM input file (INP) to which subcatchments will be added.

Functions:
    add_multiple_subcatchments: A recursive function that adds subcatchments to the model.

    land_use_type : str
        The land use type of the subcatchment.
