## How to Install

Pre-built pyg4ometry wheels can be installed [from PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pyg4ometry)
using pip:

```
pip install pyg4ometry
```

If you cannot find wheels for your operating system / architecture,
please [open an issue](https://github.com/g4edge/pyg4ometry/issues).
Building from source requires some non-Python software dependencies.
More documentation can be found in the developer's guide.
