        Analysis classes are used by PyAutoFit to fit a model to a dataset via a non-linear search.

        This class stores the Cosmology used for the analysis and settings that control specific aspects of the lensing
        calculation, for example how close the brightest pixels in the lensed source have to trace within one another
        in the source plane for the model to not be discarded.

        Parameters
        ----------

        This abstract Analysis class has attributes and methods for all model-fits which fit the model to a dataset

        including how pixelizations, inversions and lensing calculations are performed.

        Parameters
        ----------
        dataset
            The imaging, interferometer or other dataset that the model if fitted too.
        positions_likelihood
            An object which alters the likelihood function to include a term which accounts for whether
            image-pixel coordinates in arc-seconds corresponding to the multiple images of the lensed source galaxy
            trace close to one another in the source-plane.
        adapt_images
            Contains the adapt-images which are used to make a pixelization's mesh and regularization adapt to the
            reconstructed galaxy's morphology.
        cosmology
            The AstroPy Cosmology assumed for this analysis.
        settings_inversion
            Settings controlling how an inversion is fitted during the model-fit, for example which linear algebra
            formalism is used.
        raise_inversion_positions_likelihood_exception
            If an inversion is used without the `positions_likelihood` it is likely a systematic solution will
            be inferred, in which case an Exception is raised before the model-fit begins to inform the user
            of this. This exception is not raised if this input is False, allowing the user to perform the model-fit
            anyway.
        title_prefix
            A string that is added before the title of all figures output by visualization, for example to
            put the name of the dataset and galaxy in the title.
