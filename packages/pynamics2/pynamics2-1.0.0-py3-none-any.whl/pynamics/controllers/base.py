"""
This module contains the controller base class. Every controller class compatible with pynamics should inherit from this class.

Classes
-------
BaseController
    Controller base class.
"""

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
import numpy as np

class BaseController(ABC):
    """
    Base class for all controllers supported by this package.

    Every controller class compatible with pynamics should inherit from this class. This is simply an abstract base class.
    As such, it should not be used directly. Derived classes may naturally provide methods and attributes that are not 
    strictly required by this base class.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_inputs : int
        Number of controller inputs.

    n_outputs : int
        Number of controller outputs.\
        Should be the same as the system's input dimension.

    sampling_time : int | float
        Controller sampling time (in seconds).

    Attributes
    ----------
    input_dim : int
        Number of controller inputs.

    output_dim : int
        Number of controller outputs.

    Ts : int | float
        Controller sampling time (in seconds).

    Methods
    -------
    info()
        Display useful information regarding the controller.

    control(ref: np.ndarray, y: np.ndarray)
        Compute control actions for the next time instant.

    Warning
    -------
    This is an abstract base class. It should not be used directly.

        Parameters
        ----------
        ref : np.ndarray
            Array of reference values. For regulation problems, this should be an array of zeros.

        y : np.ndarray
            System state vector. Note that this refers only to the latest time instant. \
            If a controller requires information from earlier time instants, it should store \
            it internally.

        -------
        np.ndarray
            Array of control actions.
