"""
This module contains a dummy controller useful for open-loop simulations.

Classes
-------
DummyController
    A dummy controller that returns the reference value(s). Used to run open-loop simulations.
"""

class DummyController(BaseController):
    """
    This class defines the dummy controller used by the pynamics package to run
    open-loop simulations.
    The controller performs no computations.

    Attributes
    ----------
    input_dim: int
        The number of controller inputs.

    output_dim: int
        The number of control actions (one for a single-output controller / single-input system).

    Ts : int | float
        Controller sampling time.

    Methods
    -------
    info()
        Display a warning.

    control(ref: np.ndarray, y: np.ndarray)
        Compute the control actions for the next time instant. In practice, it simply outputs the value of `ref`.

        Provides useful information regarding the controller.

        This method issues a warning to the user that this 'controller' should not be used \
        as a benchmark of any kind. It is simply used for open-loop simulations.

        Computes the control actions for the next time instant.

        This method outputs the control actions for the next time instant, which in this case are simply the reference values.

        Parameters
        ----------
        ref : np.ndarray
            Array of reference values. For regulation problems, this should be an array of zeros.

        y : np.ndarray
            System state vector. Used for compatibility reasons. Unused by this 'controller'.

        Returns
        -------
        np.ndarray
            Array of control actions. In this case, the reference values themselves.
