"""
This module contains helper functions to help generate noise.

As of now, only white noise generation is supported.
However, support for coloured noise may come in the future.

def _white_noise(n_series: int, n_samples: int, power: int | float, seed: int) -> np.ndarray:
    
    """
    Generate White Gaussian Noise.

    This function generates one or more time series of white gaussian noise, each with a length of n_samples.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_series : int
        Number of white noise time series to generate.

    n_samples : int
        Number of samples (i.e. length) of each time series.

    power : int | float
        White noise power in Watt.

    seed : int
        Random seed to allow for reproducible white noise generation.

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray
        An array shaped (n_series, n_samples) containing the generated white noise time series.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If the noise power is not an integer or a float.

    ValueError
        If the noise power is negative.

    TypeError
        If the seed is not an integer.
