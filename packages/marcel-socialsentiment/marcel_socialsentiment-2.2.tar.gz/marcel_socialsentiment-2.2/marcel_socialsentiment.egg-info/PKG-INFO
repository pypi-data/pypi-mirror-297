## marcel_socialsentiment

A library will get continous scores using SentProp and Densifier Algorithm. It a a part of the original code that will help this algorithm to work in latest python versions

Developed by Marcel Tino @ 2024


You can use this to alter according to your requirements.

#==============================PARAMETERS=====================

text="The world economy is currently navigating through a complex landscape, marked by varying levels of growth across regions. While some economies are experiencing robust GDP expansion, others are grappling with the threat of a potential recession, often driven by factors like rising inflation and supply chain disruptions. Central banks in many countries are implementing monetary tightening measures, such as increasing interest rates, in an attempt to curb inflationary pressures. However, these policies run the risk of triggering stagflation, where stagnant growth coincides with high inflation. Global trade deficits and mounting national debts have further strained economic recovery efforts, particularly in emerging markets. Meanwhile, key sectors such as manufacturing and services are seeing uneven recovery rates, leading to concerns over long-term economic stability. The threat of a prolonged bear market and reduced consumer purchasing power continues to cast a shadow on global economic sentiment, with many experts warning that a sustained period of economic contraction could be on the horizon. Despite these challenges, pockets of economic resilience remain, fueled by fiscal stimulus and innovation in sectors like technology and renewable energy."
# Define your seed words
positive_seeds = ['Recovery','Innovation','Stability','growth']  # Replace with your positive seed words
negative_seeds = ['Recession','Inflation','Contraction']      # Replace with your negative seed words
#=============================================================


## To Load the Model
model1=load_model(model)

## To Pre-process the data
embeddings,words,word_to_index=prep_custom_data(text,model1)

## To map seed words and alter seedwords if it is not present in vocabulary
overall_missing_seeds=prep_seed_words(positive_seeds, negative_seeds, word_to_index,model1)


## To get Polarity Scores using SentProp
sentprop_polarity_scores = random_walk(
embeddings=embeddings,
words=words,
word_to_index=word_to_index,
positive_seeds=positive_seeds,
negative_seeds=negative_seeds,
beta=0.9
)

## To get Continous Scores using SentProp
sentprop_continous_scores = label_propagate_continuous(
    embeddings=embeddings,
    words=words,
    word_to_index=word_to_index,
    positive_seeds=positive_seeds,
    negative_seeds=negative_seeds,
    beta=0.9
)


## To get continous Scores using Densifier Algorithm
new_embeddings= Embedding(embeddings, words, normalize=True)
densify_polarity_scores = densify(
    embeddings=new_embeddings,
    positive_seeds=positive_seeds,
    negative_seeds=negative_seeds
)

##To view the final output
df=view_scores(words,sentprop_continous_scores,densify_polarity_scores)
