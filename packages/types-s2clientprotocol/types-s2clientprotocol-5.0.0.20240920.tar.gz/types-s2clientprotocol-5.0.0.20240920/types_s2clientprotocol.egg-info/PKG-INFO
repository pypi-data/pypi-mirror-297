## Typing stubs for s2clientprotocol

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`s2clientprotocol`](https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`s2clientprotocol`.

This version of `types-s2clientprotocol` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `s2clientprotocol==5.*`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/s2clientprotocol. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

Partially generated using [mypy-protobuf==3.6.0](https://github.com/nipunn1313/mypy-protobuf/tree/v3.6.0) and libprotoc 26.1 on [s2client-proto 5.0.12.91115.0](https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto/tree/c04df4adbe274858a4eb8417175ee32ad02fd609).

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit
[`c025e37bbb67f99f9d83c2eecb79e7405f77359b`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/commit/c025e37bbb67f99f9d83c2eecb79e7405f77359b) and was tested
with mypy 1.11.1, pyright 1.1.381, and
pytype 2024.9.13.
