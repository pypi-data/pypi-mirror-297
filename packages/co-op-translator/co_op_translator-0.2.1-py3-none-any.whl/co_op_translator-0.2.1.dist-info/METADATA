## Overview of Co Op Translator

**Co Op Translator** is a tool designed to automate multilingual translations for various projects using advanced Large Language Model (LLM) technology. This project aims to simplify the process of translating content into multiple languages, making it accessible and efficient for developers.

### Python Package

**Co Op Translator** Python package designed to automate multilingual translations across all files in your project. Powered by advanced Language Learning Models (LLMs), it simplifies the localization process by providing accurate and efficient translations.

Co Op Translator scans all your project files and translates all Markdown documents and even text within images found in your folders. This comprehensive approach ensures that every part of your project is accessible to a global audience.

By integrating Co Op Translator into your workflow, you can:

- **Automate Translations:** Easily translate text in your project files into multiple languages.
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** Translate all Markdown files and text within images in your project directories.
- **Advanced LLM Technology:** Utilize cutting-edge language models for high-quality translations.
- **Simplify Localization:** Streamline the process of localizing your project for international markets.
- **Easy Integration:** Seamlessly integrate with your existing project setup.

Co Op Translator empowers developers to focus on core functionalities while effortlessly managing multilingual support.

Here is an example of how Co Op Translator can be used to translate text in images and Markdown files in your project:

#### Key Features:
- **Multilingual Translation**: Supports translation into multiple languages, leveraging the power of LLMs.
- **Automation**: Automates the translation process, reducing manual effort and increasing consistency.
- **Integration**: Easily integrates with existing projects, providing a seamless translation experience.

#### Getting Started:
1. **Setting Up the Development Environment**:
   - Create a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - For Windows:
       ```bash
       venv\Scripts\activate.bat
       ```
     - For Mac/Linux:
       ```bash
       source venv/bin/activate
       ```

2. **Installing Required Packages**:
   - Install the necessary packages:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Environment Variables**:
   - Create an `.env` file in the root directory by copying the provided `.env.template` file.
   - Fill in the environment variables as guided.

4. **Installing the Package**:
   - Install the package in editable mode:
     ```bash
     pip install -e .
     ```

5. **Running Tests**:
   - Ensure the virtual environment is activated and run tests:
     ```bash
     pytest tests/
     ```

#### Sample Notebooks:

## Responsible AI

Microsoft is committed to helping our customers use our AI products responsibly, sharing our learnings, and building trust-based partnerships through tools like Transparency Notes and Impact Assessments. Many of these resources can be found at [https://aka.ms/RAI](https://aka.ms/RAI).
Microsoft’s approach to responsible AI is grounded in our AI principles of fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability.

Large-scale natural language, image, and speech models - like the ones used in this sample - can potentially behave in ways that are unfair, unreliable, or offensive, in turn causing harms. Please consult the [Azure OpenAI service Transparency note](https://learn.microsoft.com/legal/cognitive-services/openai/transparency-note?tabs=text) to be informed about risks and limitations.

The recommended approach to mitigating these risks is to include a safety system in your architecture that can detect and prevent harmful behavior. [Azure AI Content Safety](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/content-safety/overview) provides an independent layer of protection, able to detect harmful user-generated and AI-generated content in applications and services. Azure AI Content Safety includes text and image APIs that allow you to detect material that is harmful. We also have an interactive Content Safety Studio that allows you to view, explore and try out sample code for detecting harmful content across different modalities. The following [quickstart documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/content-safety/quickstart-text?tabs=visual-studio%2Clinux&pivots=programming-language-rest) guides you through making requests to the service.

Another aspect to take into account is the overall application performance. With multi-modal and multi-models applications, we consider performance to mean that the system performs as you and your users expect, including not generating harmful outputs. It's important to assess the performance of your overall application using [generation quality and risk and safety metrics](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/concepts/evaluation-metrics-built-in).

You can evaluate your AI application in your development environment using the [prompt flow SDK](https://microsoft.github.io/promptflow/index.html). Given either a test dataset or a target, your generative AI application generations are quantitatively measured with built-in evaluators or custom evaluators of your choice. To get started with the prompt flow sdk to evaluate your system, you can follow the [quickstart guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/how-to/develop/flow-evaluate-sdk). Once you execute an evaluation run, you can [visualize the results in Azure AI Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/how-to/evaluate-flow-results).
