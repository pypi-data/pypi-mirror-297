# akasha-py

## Introduction

akasha-py is an async API wrapper for [akasha.cv](https://akasha.cv/) written in Python.  
akasha.cv is a Genshin Impact leaderboard website.  
Developing something for Hoyoverse games? You might be interested in [other API wrappers](https://github.com/seriaati#api-wrappers) written by me.  
> Note: I am not the developer of akasha.cv.

## Important Notes

A couple things I want to address:  

- This wrapper is currently in-progress, some features may not work as expected, many features are also missing.
- The developer of akasha.cv mentioned to me that they change their API very frequently (and without notice), so this wrapper may break at any time.
- This wrapper was made because I wanted to integrate akasha into my [Discord bot](https://github.com/seriaati/hoyo-buddy), but I eventually stopped working on it. Therefore, this wrapper is not my current priority, but I will fix issues if you submit them.

## Installation

```bash
# poetry
poetry add akasha-py

# pip
pip install akasha-py
```

## Usage

Interact with the API using the `akasha.AkashaAPI` class.  
You can find all available methods that `AkashaAPI` provides in the [client.py](https://github.com/seriaati/akasha-py/blob/main/akasha/client.py) file.  
A quick example is provided below:

```py
import asyncio

import akasha


async def main() -> None:
    uid = 901211014
    async with akasha.AkashaAPI(akasha.Language.CHINESE_SIMPLIFIED) as api:
        # await api.refresh_user(uid)

        characters = await api.get_calculations_for_user(uid)
        for character in characters:
            calc = character.calculations[0]

            print(f"Character: {character.name}")
            print(f"Weapon: {calc.weapon.name}")
            print(f"Top {calc.top_percent:.2f}% ({calc.ranking}/{calc.out_of})")
            print(f"Damage: {round(calc.result)}")
            print()

            print("Leaderboard top 3:")
            async for board in api.get_leaderboards(calc.id, max_page=1, page_size=3):
                print(
                    f"{board.rank}. {board.owner.nickname} | Damage: {round(board.calculation.result)}"
                )
            print(f"Leadboard URL: https://akasha.cv/leaderboards/{calc.id}")

            print("=" * 50)


asyncio.run(main())
```
