# VASIM

[![Build](https://github.com/microsoft/vasim/actions/workflows/pythonapp.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/microsoft/vasim/actions/workflows/pythonapp.yml)

VASIM (**V**ertical **A**utoscaling **SIM**ulator) is a tool designed to address the complexities involved in assessing autoscaling algorithms.

VASIM is designed for testing recommendation algorithms, with a particular focus on CPU usage in VMs and Kubernetes pods. The toolkit
replicates common components found in autoscaler architectures, including the controller, metrics collector, recommender, and
resource updater. It enables a comprehensive simulation of the entire autoscaling system’s behavior, with the flexibility to customize
various parameters.

If you are writing an academic paper, you can cite [this work](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/vasim-vertical-autoscaling-simulator-toolkit/) as:

## Start here!

Our documentation and working example is in our [notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/vasim/tree/v0.1.3//examples/using_vasim.ipynb) that shows how to get started simulating your data traces and tuning parameters.  Our example provides the 3 things needed to run VASim: (1) a data csv file, (2) an autoscaling algorithm, and (3) a metadata.json file of parameters. Details of all of these can be found in the notebook.

#### Additionally:

* Within each folder, there is a README explaining the code.

  * [tests](https://github.com/microsoft/vasim/tree/v0.1.3//tests/README.md)

* For additional usage examples, see any test in the [tests](https://github.com/microsoft/vasim/tree/v0.1.3//tests) folder that starts with `test_e2e`.
