## cerf

#### `cerf` is an open-source geospatial Python package for evaluating and analyzing future electricity technology capacity expansion feasibility.

### Purpose
`cerf` was created to:

  - Evaluate the feasibility of a future scenario-driven electricity technology capacity expansion plan as generated by a parent model,

  - Site power plants in the least cost configuration when considering regional economics an on-the-ground barriers to siting,

  - Assist planners and modelers of alternate future realizations of the electricity system to gain an understanding of how siting costs and service area congestion may respond under certain stressors.


### Install `cerf`

**NOTE**:  `cerf` is not officially supported for Ubuntu 18 users due to a system dependency (`GLIBC_2.29`) required by the `whitebox` package which `cerf` uses to conduct spatial analysis. Ubuntu 18 natively includes `GLIBC_2.27`.  It may be possible for Ubuntu 18 users to upgrade to `GLIBC_2.29` but this should be done with careful consideration.  Instead, we officially support `cerf` use for Ubuntu users for versions 20.04.2 LTS and greater.

```bash
pip install cerf
```
