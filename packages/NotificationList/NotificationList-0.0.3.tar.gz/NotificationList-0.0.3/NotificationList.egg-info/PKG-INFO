        The Breach Response Notification List package is designed to streamline the process of consolidating 
        notification lists for affected parties based on unique identifiers. This package addresses the challenges 
        of generating accurate notifications while handling variations in names and ensuring no affected parties 
        are notified twice. With this tool, you can reduce the time spent on creating notification lists from 
        weeks to under a minute, even for large datasets. It generates a merging ID for all unique parties, 
        making the notification process efficient and reliable.
