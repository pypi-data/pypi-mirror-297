## Overview
**PyGCA** is a Python library, independently developed and actively maintained to detect, analyze, and optimize operator usage in Python codebases. With a focus on efficiency and ease of use, this tool empowers developers to identify performance bottlenecks and potential vulnerabilities stemming from operator misuse.

The library covers __all major operator categories__, providing insights into how operators interact within the code and where optimizations can improve overall performance. As an actively maintained project, __PyGCA__ continually evolves to stay relevant with Pythonâ€™s latest updates and to incorporate user feedback for better functionality.

## Key Features
- **Multi-operator detection**:
  - Arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, etc.)
  - Bitwise (`&`, `|`, `^`, etc.)
  - Comparison (`==`, `!=`, `>`, etc.)
  - Identity (`is`, `is not`)
  - Logical (`and`, `or`, `not`)
  - Membership (`in`, `not in`)
- **Actionable suggestions** for performance improvements
- **Detailed reporting** on operator misuse
- **Customizable settings** for different project needs

> **[!TIP]**
> To better understand the __functional__ areas of each operator category and where they overlap, the following  diagram visually represents the __scope__ of PyGCA:

```plaintext
      +----------------------------+
      |        Logical Operators   |
      |                            |
      |                            |      +---------------------------+
      | +---------+    +---------+ |      |                           |

## [Go to Installation](#installation)

**1. Clone the `repository`:**
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/clintaire/PyGCA.git
   cd PyGCA
```
**2. `Install` dependencies:**
```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

__Run__ the __Operator__ Analysis

You can analyze __any__ Python script for __operator__ usage with a simple __command__:

```bash
   python3 -m bot.operator_analysis path/to/your_script.py
```
Hereâ€™s a basic Python script with various operators that __PyGCA__ can analyze:

```python
    def analyze_example(a, b):
    # Arithmetic operators
    sum_result = a + b
    diff = a - b
    
    # Logical operators
    if a and b:
        return True
    elif a or b:
        return False

    # Bitwise operators
    result = a & b
    return result
```

**Run PyGCA and Inspect Output / __Basically__ to inspect the code above**

```bash
   python3 -m bot.operator_analysis analyze_example.py
```
**Sample Output:**

```bash
   ["Arithmetic Addition detected at line 4", "Logical AND detected at line 7", "Bitwise AND detected at line 12"]
```
__The following truth table demonstrates logical operator results and their detection by PyGCA:__

|       Expression        |       Expected Result            |     Detected Issue     |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
|    True and False       |      False                       |    No issue            |
|    False or True        |      True                        |    No issue            |
|    True and False       |      Data                        |    No issue            |
|    not True             |      False                       |    No issue            |
|    a and not b          |      Depends on vars             |    No issue            |
|    a & b (bitwise AND)  |      Depends on bits             |   Misuse ðŸ”´ Alert!     |


> [!NOTE]
> You can modify PyGCAâ€™s behavior to handle special cases or focus on specific operator categories. To run only the arithmetic or comparison checks, you can adjust configuration files or pass custom flags during execution

**To only check for Arithmetic Operators**

```bash
   python3 -m bot.operator_analysis --check-arithmetic path/to/script.py
```


- When running PyGCA on a larger codebase or a real-world project, itâ€™s important to use modular analysis and profiling techniques to measure performance impact. Hereâ€™s how to profile the performance:

```python
   import time
   from bot.arithmetic.arithmetic_checker import ArithmeticOperatorChecker
   from bot.utils import set_parents
   import ast

   # Load large source code
   source_code = """
   def large_function():
    x = 1
   """ * 10000  # Replicate a small function 10,000 times

   # Time the performance
   start_time = time.time()
   tree = ast.parse(source_code)
   set_parents(tree)
   checker = ArithmeticOperatorChecker()
   checker.visit(tree)
   end_time = time.time()

   print(f"Analysis completed in {end_time - start_time} seconds")
```
Running the above :top: code will allow you to test PyGCA on __large__ scripts, and the output will help measure its __efficiency__.

# Testing

**To ensure everything is working, you can run _PyGCAâ€™s_ test suite using pytest. This will validate the detection algorithms against various test cases:**

```bash
   PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/
```

**Upon successful execution, the terminal output should â‡™ appear as below:**
