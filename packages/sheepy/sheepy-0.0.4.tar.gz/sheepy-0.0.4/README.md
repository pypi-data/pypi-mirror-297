### Features

* **Test decoration**: Using the @sheepy decorator to mark functions as test cases.
* **Test discovery**: Automatically finding test cases within a specified class.
* **Test runner**: Executing test cases and collecting results.
* **Basic reporting**: Generating a simple pass/fail report.
* **Logging**: Providing a mechanism for logging test execution details.

### Installation

``` bash
pip install sheepy
```

### Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use Sheepy:

``` Python
from sheepy.sheeptest import SheepyTestCase

class ExampleTest(SheepyTestCase):
    def test_success(self):
        self.assertTrue(True)

    def test_failure(self):
        self.assertEqual(1, 2)

    def test_error(self):
        raise Exception("Forced error")

    @SheepyTestCase.skip("Reason to ignore")
    def test_skipped(self):
        pass

    @SheepyTestCase.expectedFailure
    def test_expected_failure(self):
        self.assertEqual(1, 2)


suite = TestSuite([ExampleTest])
runner = TestRunner(suite)
runner.run()
```

### Example output

```
Test Results:
ExampleTest.test_error: FAIL - Forced error
ExampleTest.test_expected_failure: EXPECTED FAILURE
ExampleTest.test_failure: FAIL - 1 != 2
ExampleTest.test_skipped: SKIPPED -
ExampleTest.test_success: OK
```

### Customization

Sheepy allows for customization in several ways:
